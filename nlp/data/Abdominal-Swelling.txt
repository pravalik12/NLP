Some common gastrointestinal disorders like heartburn, constipation, or irritable bowel cause abdominal bloating typically associated with discomfort or pain\n[8]\n. Some more serious causes of abdominal swelling include intestinal blockage, fluid in the abdomen, or cancer. Obesity, pregnancy, and local skin infections may also cause abdominal swelling symptoms. In many cases, especially in cases of bloating, abdominal swelling can be treated at home with lifestyle change and over the counter remedies. However, the more serious causes of abdominal swelling require evaluation and treatment by a physician.\nCommon accompanying symptoms of a abdominal swelling\nIf you're experiencing abdominal swelling, you may also experience:\nBurning sensation in chest\nor abdomen\nAbdominal pain\nDiarrhea\nConstipation\nGas\nNausea\nVomiting\nWhat Causes Abdominal Swelling?\nCommon gastrointestinal causes\nCommon causes of abdominal swelling include the following.\nHeartburn:\nHeartburn\n, or dyspepsia, is abdominal pain or burning along with bloating or feeling full after meals. It is very common, and typically has no known underlying cause. Heartburn may be the cause of mild abdominal bloating or swelling.\nIrritable bowel:\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common cause of abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea or constipation. Typically, patients either have either diarrhea or constipation, but can also have alternating diarrhea and constipation. IBS is known as a functional gastrointestinal disorder\n[1]\n, which means there is no underlying structural problem to account for the symptoms.\nBacterial overgrowth:\nThere are millions of bacteria in a normal, health gastrointestinal system. However, some people get overgrowth of abnormal bacteria in place of good bacteria which can be a cause of abdominal bloating or swelling. Typically, bacterial overgrowth presents with abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, gas, and diarrhea and diarrhea and is usually located in the small intestines\n[2]\n.\nConstipation:\nConstipation is very common in the adult population and can be associated with a variety of medications\n[3]\n, medical conditions or lifestyle factors. Constipation can present with abdominal pain or discomfort and abdominal swelling symptoms.\nAbdominal swelling due to serious underlying illness\nUnderlying illnesses that are considered serious that result in abdominal swelling include:\nBlockage in the intestine:\nThere are a variety of medical conditions that can lead to blockage in the intestines, or also known as bowel instruction\n[4]\n. Some common causes include scar tissue from prior surgery, hernias, tumors or gallstone. Typically, patients will present with abrupt pain, nausea, vomiting and abdominal distension\n[5]\n. Patients will also report inability to pass stool or gas.\nFluid in the abdomen:\nThere are a variety of medical conditions that can lead to fluid building up in the abdomen, or ascites, which leads to abdominal distention or swelling. Some of the most common causes include end stage liver disease (cirrhosis)\n[6]\n, heart failure, or cancer. In many cases, abdominal distension from fluid in the abdomen is painless.\nCancer:\nAny large tumor in the abdomen can lead to abdominal distension or swelling, either as a direct result of the growing tumor or from inflammation or fluid surrounding it. This swelling is typically painless, but patients might have other symptoms like weight loss, fevers, or night sweats.\nOther causes of abdominal swelling\nOther causes of abdominal swelling include the following.\nSkin infection:\nIf the swelling is limited to one section of the abdomen, it may be due to an infection in the skin. Typically, skin infections cause localized redness, swelling, and tenderness. Skin infections are typically caused by bacteria and treated with antibiotics.\nObesity:\nIncreased abdominal girth\n[7]\nover time can be due to weight gain or obesity.\nPregnancy:\nIncreasing abdominal girth can be due to pregnancy.\n10 Possible Abdominal Swelling Conditions\nThe list below shows results from the use of our quiz by Buoy users who experienced abdominal swelling. This list does not constitute medical advice and may not accurately represent what you have.\nIrritable bowel syndrome (ibs)\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder of the large intestine.

Someone is considered \"lactose intolerant\" when the small intestine cannot produce enough of the enzyme that digests lactose called lactase.\nIn primary lactose intolerance, the enzyme is produced during childhood but declines sub...\nRead more\nPossible pregnancy\nThe earliest sign of pregnancy is typically a missed period, but many women do experience symptoms shortly after conception:\nImplantation bleeding may occur after six to twelve days, when the fertilized egg implants itself into the lining of the uterus. This can cause mild cramping with light bleeding or spotting.\nFatigue and increased desire to sleep may happen within a week.\nBreast tenderness can start as soon as one to two weeks.\nNausea (\"morning sickness\") can occur after two to eight weeks.\nIf pregnancy is suspected, testing should be done so that proper prenatal care can begin. It's important to avoid some behaviors during pregnancy, such as drinking alcohol or using certain drugs or medications, so an early diagnosis should be made.\nOver-the-counter home pregnancy tests are available at any drugstore. A positive test is almost certainly correct, but a negative test in the face of other symptoms may be a false negative and should be tried again after a week.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nfatigue, nausea or vomiting, stomach bloating, bloody vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding\nSymptoms that always occur with possible pregnancy:\nmissed period\nSymptoms that never occur with possible pregnancy:\npainful urination, severe abdominal pain\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nOvarian cyst\nDuring her reproductive years, a woman's ovaries release a single egg cell each month. But sometimes the egg remains on the surface of the ovary, where the follicle that enclosed it continues to grow. It then becomes a fluid-filled ovarian cyst.\nOvarian cysts may be caused by hormonal imbalances; by endometriosis tissue, if it attaches to the ovary; and by severe pelvic infections that spread to the ovaries. Cysts may also form during pregnancy.\nSmall ovarian cysts often cause no symptoms. Larger cysts may cause pelvic pain, backache, unexplained weight gain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and/or pain during sex. Ovarian cysts are almost never a form of cancer.\nSudden, severe abdominal pain could indicate a ruptured cyst. This is a medical emergency and the patient should go to an emergency room or call 9-1-1.\nDiagnosis is made through ultrasound.\nHormonal birth control, such as the pill, injection, or patch, prevents ovulation and therefore prevents the formation of cysts. Surgery to remove the cyst may be necessary in some cases.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nstomach bloating, vaginal bleeding, pelvis pain, lower abdominal pain, lower back pain\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nUterine fibroids\nUterine fibroids are benign growths in the wall of the uterus and most often appear during childbearing years. Fibroids are almost never associated with cancer.\nThose at higher risk include black women and women who started their periods at a young age. Other risk factors are vitamin D deficiency, poor diet, obesity, drinking alcohol, and family history of fibroids.\nFibroids can cause pelvic pressure and pain, severe menstrual cramping, and heavy menstrual bleeding that leads to anemia. Quality of life is diminished due to the chronic pain and discomfort. Though fibroids don't always make it impossible to become pregnant, infertility and pregnancy loss may occur as well as pre-term delivery.\nFibroids can be diagnosed through a routine pelvic exam or ultrasound in a doctor's office.\nA gynecologist can prescribe various medications to ease the symptoms and regulate the menstrual cycle. There are also a number of surgical techniques, some minimally invasive, to shrink or remove the fibroids while leaving the uterus in place. Hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, is an option in some cases.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nvaginal bleeding, pelvis pain, abdominal cramps (stomach cramps), painful periods, irregular period\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nAbdominal Swelling Symptom Checker\nTake a quiz to find out what might be causing your abdominal swelling\nTake quiz\nCirrhosis\nCirrhosis is scarring of the liver.

If something interferes with circulation so that blood flow is trapped within the compartment, pressure rises because the fascia cannot stretch. This causes serious damage to the muscles and other tissues within the compartment.\nAcute compartment syndrome is caused by a broken bone; a crush injury; burns, due to scarred and tightened skin; and bandages or casts applied before an injury has stopped swelling.\nSymptoms can rapidly intensify. They include severe pain and tightness in the muscle; tingling or burning sensation; and sometimes numbness and weakness.\nAcute compartment syndrome is a medical emergency which can result in loss of the limb. Take the patient to the emergency room or call 9-1-1.\nDiagnosis is made through patient history and physical examination.\nTreatment involves hospitalization for emergency surgery and, in some cases, skin graft.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\narm numbness, hand numbness, foot numbness, pain in one leg, thigh numbness\nUrgency:\nHospital emergency room\nSmall bowel obstruction\nThe small bowel, or small intestine, is a long, coiled, tube-like structure that connects the stomach to the large intestine (the large bowel, or colon.) If the small bowel is blocked for any reason, food and liquid cannot pass through. This is a medical emergency.\nThere a number of possible causes. Scar tissue called adhesions can form after any abdominal surgery (including Caesarean section.) Inflammation from Crohn's disease or diverticulitis causes the intestinal wall to thicken and narrow. Hernias or tumors can also cause blockage.\nSymptoms include inability to have a bowel movement or pass gas; abdominal cramping and swelling; loss of appetite; and vomiting.\nIf not treated, a small bowel obstruction can cut off the blood supply to the small intestine. This leads to tissue death, which can then tear and cause an infection in the abdominal cavity called peritonitis. Both of these are medical emergencies.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination, x-ray, CT scan, and/or ultrasound.\nOnce diagnosed, most patients are hospitalized. Surgery may be necessary to clear the obstruction.\nRarity:\nUncommon\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea, stomach bloating, being severely ill, abdominal cramps (stomach cramps)\nSymptoms that always occur with small bowel obstruction:\nbeing severely ill\nUrgency:\nHospital emergency room\nAt-Home, Professional, and Emergency Treatments for Abdominal Swelling\nMany causes of abdominal swelling, especially if the swelling is simple bloating, can be managed at home. There are many over-the-counter and natural remedies for constipation. There are also over-the-counter medications to treat heartburn. If you are experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms that might be food-related, avoiding the offending foods and changing your diet may help. However, some causes of abdominal swelling should be evaluated by a physician. Imaging\n[9]\n, prescription medication, and surgery are all possible treatments your physician may recommend depending on the cause of the abdominal swelling symptoms.\nWhen abdominal swelling is an emergency\nSeek emergency abdominal swelling treatment if you experience very severe abdominal pain with nausea or vomiting.\nAt-home abdominal swelling treatments\nYou may find relief from abdominal swelling with the following at-home treatments.\nLifestyle changes:\nIf you believe your constipation, irritable bowel, or heartburn is due to a specific type of food, try avoiding the food to help relieve symptoms. Some common offenders for heartburn include fatty foods or acidic foods like coffee, tomatoes, or citrus. Some common offenders for constipation include dairy, white rice or bread, and bananas\n[10]\n.\nNatural constipation remedies:\nThere are many popular natural remedies for constipation including taking magnesium supplements\n[11]\n, increasing your fiber intake, or increasing your intake of probiotic foods or supplements.\nOver-the-counter medications:\nThere are many over the counter medications that could treat constipation or heartburn if they are the cause of your abdominal swelling.\nEnema:\nAn enema is placed into the rectum to relieve constipation, with most enemas available over the counter.\nMedical treatments for abdominal swelling\nAfter consulting your physician, he or she may recommend the following measures.\nImaging:\nYour doctor may order X-rays, ultrasound, or CT scans if they suspect intestinal blockage, fluid in the abdomen, or other possible structural causes of abdominal swelling.\nEndoscopy (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD) or Colonoscopy:\nIf your doctor suspects your abdominal swelling is related to a medical condition, they may recommend a type of imaging that requires using a camera in a scope to look at the inside of the gastrointestinal track, either through the mouth or through the rectum.\nMedications:\nYour doctor can prescribe various medications to treat heartburn, bacterial overgrowth, irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, or infections that may be causing your abdominal swelling.\nSurgery:\nIt is unlikely, however, if a blockage in the intestines is causing abdominal swelling, a doctor may recommend surgery to treat the problem. In this case, your doctor would discuss the risks and benefits of surgery as treatment for the condition.\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Abdominal Swelling\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nHave you been feeling more tired than usual, lethargic or fatigued despite sleeping a normal amount?\nAny fever today or during the last week?\nHave you experienced any nausea?\nHave you lost your appetite recently?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
