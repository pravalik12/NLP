This list does not constitute medical advice and may not accurately represent what you have.\nLipoma\nLipoma is a word that translates as \"fatty tumor,\" but a lipoma is not cancer. It is simply a growth of fat between the muscle layer and the skin above it.\nThe exact cause is not known. The condition does run in families and is associated with other unusual syndromes such as adiposis dolorosa, which is similar. Lipomas most often appear after age 40.\nSymptoms include a soft, easily moveable lump beneath the skin, about two inches across. A lipoma is painless unless its growth is irritating the nerves around it. They are most often found on the back, neck, and abdomen, and sometimes the arms and upper legs.\nIt is a good idea to have any new or unusual growth checked by a medical provider, just to make certain it is benign.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination, biopsy, and imaging such as ultrasound or CT scan.\nMost of the time, treatment is not necessary unless the lipoma is unsightly or is interfering with other structures. It can be removed through surgery or liposuction.\nRarity:\nUncommon\nTop Symptoms:\nskin-colored groin bump, marble sized groin lump, small groin lump\nSymptoms that always occur with lipoma:\nskin-colored groin bump\nUrgency:\nWait and watch\nSkin cyst\nA cyst is a small sac or lump, filled with fluid, air, fat, or other material, that begins to grow somewhere in the body for no apparent reason. A skin cyst is one that forms just beneath the skin.\nIt's believed that skin cysts form around trapped keratin cells \u2013 the cells that form the relatively tough outer layer of the skin.\nThese cysts are not contagious.\nAnyone can get a skin cyst, but they are most common in those who are over age 18, have acne, or have injured the skin.\nSymptoms include the appearance of a small, rounded lump under the skin. Cysts are normally painless unless infected, when they will be reddened and sore and contain pus.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination. A small cyst can be left alone, though if it is unsightly or large enough to interfere with movement it can be removed in a simple procedure done in a doctor's office. An infected cyst must be treated so that the infection does not spread.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nskin-colored armpit bump, marble sized armpit lump, small armpit lump\nSymptoms that always occur with skin cyst:\nskin-colored armpit bump\nUrgency:\nWait and watch\nWart\nWarts, also called common warts or verrucae, are small, rough, rounded growths on the top layer of the skin. They may appear alone or in clusters. Common warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and are contagious through direct contact. They may spread from one place on the body to another simply through touch.\n...\nRead more\nSkin-Colored Abdominal Bump Symptom Checker\nTake a quiz to find out what might be causing your skin-colored abdominal bump\nTake quiz\nBenign skin growth\nBenign skin growths are very common and virtually everyone has some form of them. \"Benign\" means the growth is not cancerous and not harmful. Some of these growths have genetic origins, and for some the cause is not clear.\nCommon types are:\nBirthmarks \u2013 may appear as flat \"stains\" in the skin or as raised clusters formed of tiny blood vessels.\nMoles \u2013 small irregularities that originate in the pigment-producing cells in the skin. They can be almost any shape or color but are normally no larger than one-quarter of an inch across.\nSkin tags \u2013 little irregular flaps of skin, like a flattened mole attached on only one side.\nKeloids \u2013 a dark, fibrous form of scar tissue that forms after a skin wound, either from trauma or from surgery.\nAs a person ages, more changes may appear in the skin. Most are benign, but any unusual or suspicious skin growth should be checked by a medical provider. The growth can be removed if it is unsightly, interferes with clothing, or proves to be malignant (cancerous.)\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nconstant skin changes, itchy rash, rash with well-defined border, abdominal skin changes, neck skin changes\nSymptoms that always occur with benign skin growth:\nconstant skin changes\nSymptoms that never occur with benign skin growth:\ncherry red lower leg bump\nUrgency:\nWait and watch\nMolluscum contagiosum\nMolluscum contagiosum, also called \"water warts,\" is a common, benign, viral skin infection. It causes a rash of bumps that may appear anywhere on the body.\nThe virus spreads through direct contact with the bumps, including sexual contact. It also spreads through touching any object that an infected person has handled, such as clothing, towels, and toys.\nMost susceptible are children under age 10. Other risk factors include dermatitis causing breaks in the skin; a weakened immune system; and living in warm, humid regions under crowded conditions.\nSymptoms include a rash of small, pale bumps with a pit in the center. The rash is usually painless but may become reddened, itchy, and sore.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination.\nIn some cases, treatment is not needed and the condition will clear on its own. However, if the bumps are unsightly or are present in the genital area, lesions can be removed through minor surgical procedures or treated with oral medication or topical agents.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nrash with bumps or blisters, leg skin changes, skin changes on arm, head or neck skin changes, genital skin changes\nSymptoms that never occur with molluscum contagiosum:\nfever, headache\nUrgency:\nPhone call or in-person visit\nDermatofibroma\nA dermatofibroma is a common skin growth that usually appears on the lower legs, but may appear anywhere on the body.
