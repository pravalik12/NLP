This list does not constitute medical advice and may not accurately represent what you have.\nNormal abdominal pain\nThe complaint of nonspecific abdominal pain and discomfort, with no apparent cause, is one of the most common in medicine. It is a primary reason for patients to visit a medical provider or the emergency room.\nThe cause of abdominal pain can be difficult to find, because it can come from many different sources: the digestive tract, the urinary tract, the pancreas, the gall bladder, or the gynecologic organs.\nThe pain may simply be caused by overly sensitive nerves in the gut. This hypersensitivity can occur after repeated abdominal injury and/or it may have an emotional cause due to fear of the pain itself.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination, patient history, and simply ruling out any other condition. CT scan is often requested, but can rarely find a specific cause. The benefits must be weighed against the risks of radiation.\nTreatment first involves making any needed lifestyle improvements regarding diet, exercise, work, and sleep, in order to reduce stress. In some cases, counseling, hypnosis, mild pain relievers, and antidepressants are helpful.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), vaginal discharge, fever, nausea\nSymptoms that always occur with normal abdominal pain:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache)\nSymptoms that never occur with normal abdominal pain:\nfever, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, severe abdominal pain, unintentional weight loss, vaginal discharge\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nIrritable bowel syndrome (ibs)\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder of the large intestine.

Note: Heartburn is a separate condition.\nCommon causes are eating too much or too rapidly; greasy or spicy foods; overdoing caffeine, alcohol, or carbonated beverages; smoking; and anxiety. Some antibiotics, pain relievers, and vitamin/mineral supplements can cause indigestion.\nThe most common symptoms are pain, discomfort, and bloating in the upper abdomen soon after eating.\nIndigestion that lasts longer than two weeks, and does not respond to simple treatment, may indicate a more serious condition. Upper abdominal pain that radiates to the jaw, neck, or arm is a medical emergency.\nDiagnosis is made through patient history and physical examination. If the symptoms began suddenly, laboratory tests on blood, breath, and stool may be ordered. Upper endoscopy or abdominal x-ray may be done.\nFor functional dyspepsia \u2013 \"ordinary\" indigestion \u2013 treatment and prevention are the same. Eating five or six smaller meals per day with lighter, simpler food; managing stress; and finding alternatives for some medications will provide relief.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nnausea, stomach bloating, dyspeptic symptoms, bloating after meals, vomiting\nSymptoms that always occur with indigestion (dyspepsia):\ndyspeptic symptoms\nSymptoms that never occur with indigestion (dyspepsia):\nvomiting (old) blood or passing tarry stools, rectal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, fever\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nMild Abdominal Pain Symptom Checker\nTake a quiz to find out what might be causing your mild abdominal pain\nTake quiz\nViral (norovirus) infection\nIf you ever heard of an entire cruise ship of people coming down with the same \u201cstomach bug,\u201d chances are that was norovirus.

Anywhere from three times a day to three times a week is considered normal.\nAs long as stools are easy to pass, laxatives should not be used in an effort to force the body to a more frequent schedule.\nConstipation is usually caused by lack of fiber in the diet; not drinking enough water; insufficient exercise; and often suppressing the urge to have a bowel movement.\nA number of medications and remedies, especially narcotic pain relievers, can cause constipation.\nWomen are often affected, due to pregnancy and other hormonal changes. Young children who demand low-fiber or \"junk food\" diets are also susceptible.\nConstipation is a condition, not a disease, and most of the time is easily corrected. If simple adjustments in diet, exercise, and bowel habits don't help, a doctor can be consulted to rule out a more serious cause.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea, stomach bloating, constipation, constipation\nSymptoms that always occur with normal variation of constipation:\nconstipation\nSymptoms that never occur with normal variation of constipation:\nvomiting\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Mild Abdominal Pain\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nHave you experienced any nausea?\nAny fever today or during the last week?\nHow would you describe the nature of your abdominal pain?\nHave you been feeling more tired than usual, lethargic or fatigued despite sleeping a normal amount?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
