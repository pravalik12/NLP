Maybe you were hoping a few crackers would settle your stomach pains, especially if you hadn't eaten much earlier in the day, but instead, you're in more pain than you were before. Abdominal pain that gets worse after eating can actually be due to a wide variety of causes, making it important to seek care.\nCommon characteristics of abdominal pain that gets worse after eating\nPostprandial pain in itself has a strong connection to food that you eat. Most people can even pinpoint which foods trigger their symptoms the most. For example, it's common to experience symptoms after eating spicy food or food that's high in fat content. Indigestion (also known as dyspepsia) is also a common characteristic. Indigestion is persistent discomfort or pain in the upper abdomen.\nCommon accompanying symptoms of abdominal pain that gets worse after eating\nPostprandial pain may also be associated with the following:\nFever\nHeartburn\nNausea and vomiting\nConstipation and/or diarrhea\nBloating\nBelching\nJaundice:\nThis is a yellow tint or appearance of the skin.\nDepending on the cause, postprandial pain and associated symptoms can be very severe and last for many minutes. Make an appointment with your healthcare provider as soon as you notice any of these symptoms.\nAbdominal Pain That Get Worse After Eating Causes\nPostprandial pain occurs when there is either inflammation/irritation of the structures of the digestive tract or obstruction of these components. You experience pain after you eat because your body is attempting to digest food normally, but is having to do so within the context of injury.\nInflammatory causes\nAny of the organs of the abdomen can become inflamed due to infectious causes or irritation from a variety of substances, including certain foods.\nInfectious:\nThere are many pathogens, both bacterial and viral, that can infect the organs of the abdomen, particularly in the upper right quadrant. For example, hepatitis is a viral infection that can infect the liver.\nIrritation:\nSince the upper abdomen is the primary location for food to be processed for digestion, it is susceptible to irritation in multiple ways. Toxic substances such as alcohol and smoking can cause irritation that leads to inflammation and ulceration. Certain medications such as non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can lead to irritation of the stomach lining with overuse. Moreover, the acid that the stomach makes to digest food can irritate the components of the digestive tract, including the esophagus, and this can also cause postprandial pain.\nObstructive causes\nThe following can result in obstructions of the gastrointestinal system.\nCancer:\nCancer can develop in any organ of the abdomen/digestive tract. Malignancies of the pancreas or stomach are often related to postprandial pain given their necessity to proper digestion.\nGallstones:\nThe upper right quadrant of the abdomen is specifically home to the gallbladder. The gallbladder is part of the digestive system and responsible for making bile, a fluid that helps break down fat. Often, stones (gallstones) can form inside the gallbladder. These gallstones can vary in size and cause many problems that may result in postprandial pain when the body tries to break down fats.\n10 Possible Abdominal Pain That Get Worse After Eating Conditions\nThe list below shows results from the use of our quiz by Buoy users who experienced abdominal pain that get worse after eating.

Note: Heartburn is a separate condition.\nCommon causes are eating too much or too rapidly; greasy or spicy foods; overdoing caffeine, alcohol, or carbonated beverages; smoking; and anxiety. Some antibiotics, pain relievers, and vitamin/mineral supplements can cause indigestion.\nThe most common symptoms are pain, discomfort, and bloating in the upper abdomen soon after eating.\nIndigestion that lasts longer than two weeks, and does not respond to simple treatment, may indicate a more serious condition. Upper abdominal pain that radiates to the jaw, neck, or arm is a medical emergency.\nDiagnosis is made through patient history and physical examination. If the symptoms began suddenly, laboratory tests on blood, breath, and stool may be ordered. Upper endoscopy or abdominal x-ray may be done.\nFor functional dyspepsia \u2013 \"ordinary\" indigestion \u2013 treatment and prevention are the same. Eating five or six smaller meals per day with lighter, simpler food; managing stress; and finding alternatives for some medications will provide relief.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nnausea, stomach bloating, dyspeptic symptoms, bloating after meals, vomiting\nSymptoms that always occur with indigestion (dyspepsia):\ndyspeptic symptoms\nSymptoms that never occur with indigestion (dyspepsia):\nvomiting (old) blood or passing tarry stools, rectal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, fever\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nIrritable bowel syndrome (ibs)\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder of the large intestine.

It is also called acute mesenteric ischemia, or AMI.\nThe ischemia is caused by blockage in one of the arteries leading into the abdomen, usually due to atherosclerosis (plaque) or a blood clot.\nMost susceptible are those with very high or low blood pressure; heart disease; or using illegal drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamine.\nSymptoms include sudden, severe pain in one area of the abdomen; nausea and vomiting; and repeated, urgent bowel movements, often with blood.\nAcute intestinal ischemia is a life-threatening medical emergency. If it is suspected, take the patient to the emergency room or call 9-1-1.\nDiagnosis is made through arteriogram, which involves injecting dye into the abdominal arteries under x-ray in order to find the exact location of the blockage.\nTreatment involves \"clot-busting\" drugs to destroy a clot, or emergency surgery to remove whatever is causing the blockage and possibly some of the damaged intestine as well.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, being severely ill\nUrgency:\nHospital emergency room\nDiverticulosis\nDiverticulosis is the common condition of small, sac-like pouches forming and pushing outward along the inside of the colon, called diverticula.

If not treated, chronic pancreatitis can lead to permanent pancreatic damage, diabetes, malnutrition, and chronic pain.\nDiagnosis is made through patient history, physical examination, and imaging such as x-ray, CT scan, or ultrasound.\nTreatment involves pain management through both medication and surgical procedures. Lifestyle improvements through diet, exercise, and stress management can also be very helpful.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nfatigue, abdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea or vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain that comes and goes\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nCeliac disease\nCeliac disease is also called gluten-sensitive enteropathy, coeliac, or sprue. It is an autoimmune response in the gut to gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, and barley.\nRepeated exposure to gluten causes damage to the lining of the small intestine.\nMost at risk are Caucasians with:\nFamily history of celiac disease.\nDown syndrome.\nType 1 diabetes.\nRheumatoid arthritis.\nAutoimmune thyroid disease.\nSymptoms include digestive upset with gas, bloating, and diarrhea. The malnutrition causes fatigue, weight loss, fragile bones, severe skin rash, mouth ulcers, anemia, and damage to the spleen and nervous system.\nA swollen belly, failure to thrive, muscle wasting, and learning disabilities are seen in children, and normal growth and development can be severely affected.\nDiagnosis is made through blood testing and endoscopy, and sometimes biopsy of the small intestine.\nThere is no cure for the condition, but celiac disease can be managed by removing all gluten from the diet. Nutritional supplements will be used and sometimes steroid medication is given to help heal the gut.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nfatigue, stomach bloating, nausea, constipation, diarrhea\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nLactose intolerance\nLactose is a sugar that naturally occurs in milk.

There are multiple treatment modalities that may provide relief.\nAt-home treatments\nFortunately, since most causes of postprandial pain are relatively benign, there are treatments you can first try at home to help alleviate your symptoms. Antacids are common over-the-counter medications (Tums, Pepto-Bismol, etc.) that can be very helpful in relieving some causes of postprandial pain because they work to neutralize excess stomach acid. However, antacids will not help with inflammatory or obstructive causes of postprandial pain.\nWhen to see a doctor\nIf your symptoms persist despite the at-home remedies above, make an appointment with your doctor to receive a proper diagnosis. Once your doctor has determined a possible cause, he or she may recommend:\nMedications:\nFor example, in the case of gallstones, there are some medications that can break them up without the need for surgery. If your symptoms are due to infection, you may receive antibiotics to relieve your condition.\nSurgery:\nSurgery to remove gallstones or the gallbladder entirely is a very common procedure, especially for people who suffer from chronic gallstones. Often, the entire gallbladder is removed.\nBowel rest:\nYour doctor may suggest a lighter diet that will allow your intestines and digestive system to recover after inflammatory or infectious causes of abdominal pain\n[2]\n.\nWhen it is an emergency\nSeek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms including:\nSudden, severe pain\nFever\nBloody stools\nNausea and vomiting that persists\nWeight loss\nSevere tenderness when you touch your abdomen\nSwelling of the abdomen\nThese could be signs of a serious obstruction or inflammation of the organs of the abdomen that needs immediate assessment.\nPrevention\nThere are also many strategies you can try in order to stay a step ahead of your symptoms.\nLimit NSAID use:\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve) can cause and/or aggravate postprandial pain. Talk to your doctor about alternatives you can use.\nLimit consumption of spicy, fatty, or acidic foods:\nCertain foods in these categories (caffeine, carbonated beverages, citrus fruits or juices, etc.) are believed to be triggers of postprandial pain.\nAvoid alcohol and quit smoking:\nAlcohol and smoking are associated with increased production of stomach acid and thus irritation of the abdominal lining.\nFAQs About Abdominal Pain That Get Worse After Eating\nCan I prevent postprandial pain?\nYes, depending on the cause. Making lifestyle changes, such as limiting your use of alcohol or NSAIDs, can also reduce the chance for ulceration of your stomach lining (peptic or gastric ulcers). You can also prevent symptoms by stopping smoking or not taking up smoking in the first place.\nWhat is Helicobacter pylori?\nHelicobacter pylori are bacteria that specifically infect the gastrointestinal tract. The inflammation and irritation this bacteria causes can lead to conditions such as gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and even gastric cancer. More than half of the world\u2019s population is colonized by these bacteria\n[3]\n. Fortunately, the management and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infections are well-studied.\nHow are Helicobacter pylori transmitted?\nEven though there are many hypotheses for how Helicobacter pylori are transmitted, their major mode of transmission is not specifically known. Possible routes of infection include oral-oral (from human saliva to human saliva), fecal-oral (accidental contamination of food with feces), and sometimes spread via inadvertent use of unsterile medical equipment such as probes or endoscopes\n[4]\n.\nHow can I live without my gallbladder?\nGallbladder removal is a very common surgery. Removal of the gallbladder does not significantly affect digestion because the liver can also make bile to help with the break down of fatty foods. Symptoms experienced after gallbladder removal include gas, bloating, or more watery bowel movements. Fortunately, there is a very small chance that gallstones will recur after removal.\nIs postprandial pain life-threatening?\nSome causes of postprandial pain such as pancreatitis can be very serious and severe. According to a large epidemiologic study from the United States, approximately 15-25% of patients with acute pancreatitis develop severe pancreatitis\n[5]\n. Severe pancreatitis can result in fever, hypotension, and organ failure and require monitoring in the intensive care unit. It is important to not ignore symptoms of pain in the upper abdomen and seek medical attention before the condition worsens.\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Abdominal Pain That Get Worse After Eating\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nHave you experienced any nausea?\nAny fever today or during the last week?\nHave you lost your appetite recently?\nHave you been feeling more tired than usual, lethargic or fatigued despite sleeping a normal amount?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
