Acute abdomen represents the rapid onset of severe symptoms that is always the result of an underlying problem.\nSevere abdominal pain\nalso requires urgent care and immediate intervention.\nCommon accompanying symptoms of abdominal pain\nAlong with severe abdominal pain, you may experience:\nFever\nNausea\nVomiting\nTenderness when you touch the stomach\nDiarrhea that can be bloody\nCramping\nAbdominal distension\nBloating\nAbdominal rigidity\nAlso pay attention to the quality and location of the pain. Your pain may be localized and limited to one area of the abdomen. It may be intermittent, or colicky, which is a term that describes pain that is sudden and feels like a severe muscle spasm\n[2]\n. The pain may feel cramping and give you a tightening feeling in your stomach.\nSevere Abdominal Pain Causes\nCauses of severe abdominal pain symptoms are broad and the list may seem daunting - making it all the more important for you to seek medical attention as soon as possible if you experience symptoms\n[3]\n.\nInflammatory causes\nInflammation of the organs or structures around the abdomen can result in severe abdominal pain.\nOrgan inflammation:\nConditions that cause inflammation to the organs of the abdomen can result in sudden abdominal pain that persists and worsens over time. For example, appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix that results in abdominal pain that often starts around the belly button and travels to the\nright lower abdomen\n. The pain can be extremely severe and debilitating. Inflammation of the pancreas is pancreatitis and usually associated with nausea and vomiting. Other abdominal organs that can be inflamed causing severe pain include the gall bladder, liver and kidneys.\nInfection:\nBacterial and viral infections that affect the abdomen can also result in severe abdominal pain. The general medical term for an intestinal infection is gastroenteritis. Often the pain associated with these conditions results in vomiting, diarrhea and nausea.\nObstructive causes\nAn obstruction somewhere in the abdomen can result in severe pain.\nIntestinal:\nMany things can cause obstruction in the intestine that blocks food or liquid from passing through normally. Often fibrous bands of tissue called adhesions will form in the abdomen after surgery or other inflammatory conditions and lead to obstruction. When these adhesions are not treated, they block blood flow (ischemia) resulting in severe abdominal pain symptoms. Hernias and diverticula (bulging pouches in the digestive tract) can also cause such obstruction. Sometimes the intestines can twist on itself causing obstruction in a condition called intestinal volvulus.\nStones:\nHardened materials of calcium, digestive fluid, and other substances can form and deposit in different organs of the abdomen leading to obstruction and severe abdominal pain\n[4]\n. The kidney and gallbladder are parts of the abdomen that are very susceptible to stone formation. These stones not only block but also irritate the surrounding organ resulting in pain and discomfort that can be exacerbated with things like eating or moving.\nReproductive causes\nSevere pain due to issues with the reproductive system may be felt in the abdomen.\nMale:\nA condition called testicular torsion in males can result in severe referred abdominal pain symptoms. Torsion occurs when the testicle rotates around the spermatic cord. This condition can result in a lump because the twisting can block blood flow to the scrotum. This blockage will result in buildup and swelling that can appear as a lump. Torsion is extremely painful and extremely dangerous.\nFemale:\nComplications of pregnancy such as miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy can result in severe abdominal pain in addition to\nvaginal bleeding\n. In non-pregnant women, conditions such as ovarian torsion (when the ovary twists arounds it's cord and limits blood flow) as well as ovarian cyst rupture can result in sharp, severe abdominal pain.\nTraumatic causes\nDirect trauma to the abdomen such as in a car accident can result in injury and or rupture of the organs. The spleen and liver are organs especially susceptible to rupture during traumatic situations and the resulting blood in the abdomen can irritate the lining of the stomach and further exacerbate pain.\n10 Possible Severe Abdominal Pain Conditions\nThe list below shows results from the use of our quiz by Buoy users who experienced severe abdominal pain. This list does not constitute medical advice and may not accurately represent what you have.\nGallstones\nGallstones are small, round deposits found in the gallbladder, the organ where bile is stored. Gallstones can be subclassified a number of ways. Oftentimes, gallstones will be referred to as either cholesterol stones or pigment stones depending on the makeup of the gallstone.\nGallstones can also be class...\nRead more\nGall bladder infection (cholecystitis)\nGallbladder infection, also called cholecystitis, means there is a bacterial infection of the gallbladder either with or without gallstones.\nThe gallbladder is a small organ that stores bile, which helps to digest fats. If something blocks the flow of bile out of the gallbladder \u2013 gallstones, damage to the bile ducts, or tumors in the gallbladder \u2013 the bile stagnates and bacteria multiplies in it, producing an infected gallbladder.\nRisk factors include obesity, a high-fat diet, and a family history of gallstones.\nSymptoms include fever; chills; right upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the right shoulder; and sometimes nausea and vomiting. A gallbladder infection is an acute (sudden) illness, while the symptoms of gallstones come on gradually.\nUntreated cholecystitis can lead to rupture of the gallbladder, which can be life-threatening.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination, ultrasound or other imaging, and blood tests.\nTreatment involves hospitalizing the patient for fasting with IV fluids, to rest the gallbladder; antibiotics; and pain medication. Surgery to remove the gallbladder is often done so that the condition cannot recur.\nRarity:\nUncommon\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation\nSymptoms that always occur with gall bladder infection (cholecystitis):\nabdominal pain (stomach ache)\nSymptoms that never occur with gall bladder infection (cholecystitis):\npain in the upper left abdomen, pain in the lower left abdomen\nUrgency:\nHospital emergency room\nAcute abdomen\nAcute abdomen refers to sudden, severe abdominal pain that is considered a medical emergency, requiring immediate diagnosis and often urgent surgical intervention. People of both genders and all ages are at risk for acute abdomen because it can have such varied causes.\nSymptoms include a predomin...\nRead more\nStomach ulcer\nA peptic ulcer is a sore in the lining of the stomach or the first part of your small intestine (the duodenum), which causes pain following meals or on an empty stomach.\nRarity:\nUncommon\nTop Symptoms:\nfatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, moderate abdominal pain, abdominal cramps (stomach cramps)\nSymptoms that never occur with stomach ulcer:\npain in the lower left abdomen\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nOvarian torsion\nOvarian torsion, also called adnexal torsion or tubo-ovarian torsion, is the twisting of the \"stem,\" or supporting fleshy pedicle, of the ovary.\nThis condition can occur when a mass forms on the surface of the ovary and pulls it over. This is most often a complication of cystic ovaries.\nIt is most common in women under thirty or past menopause. It can occur during pregnancy.\nSymptoms include severe, one-sided, lower abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting.\nDiagnosis is made by ultrasound. The ovary will appear enlarged due to the torsion cutting off the circulation. There will be free pelvic fluid and a twisted pedicle.\nOvarian torsion is a medical emergency. The ovary can die due to loss of circulation, causing infection, abscess, or peritonitis. Surgery must be done to prevent tissue death and subsequent complications. In the majority of cases the affected ovary must be removed, which also removes the cyst or mass that caused the torsion.\nProper treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can help prevent at least one cause of ovarian torsion.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea or vomiting, nausea, moderate abdominal pain, loss of appetite\nSymptoms that never occur with ovarian torsion:\ndiarrhea, pain below the ribs, mild abdominal pain\nUrgency:\nHospital emergency room\nSevere Abdominal Pain Symptom Checker\nTake a quiz to find out what might be causing your severe abdominal pain\nTake quiz\nEctopic pregnancy\nEctopic pregnancy is a fairly common condition (one to two percent of all pregnancies). An ectopic pregnancy is one that occurs outside the uterus, which is the normal site of fetal development.\nThe hallmark symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include severe abdominal pain, vaginal bleed...\nRead more\nRuptured ovarian cyst\nIt is normal for one of the two ovaries to create a small follicle each month. This follicle contains an egg cell that is released as part of the menstrual cycle.\nIn some cases, however, the egg cell fails to release. The follicle becomes overgrown and may eventually rupture, especially during sexual activity or strenuous exercise.\nSymptoms of a ruptured ovarian cyst may be mild and only require over-the-counter pain relievers.\nHowever, sudden severe pain on one side of the lower abdomen, especially with vaginal bleeding, may indicate internal bleeding and is a medical emergency. Take the patient to the emergency room or call 9-1-1.\nDiagnosis is made through patient history, physical examination, and ultrasound, as well as blood tests and urine tests to rule out any other cause for the symptoms.\nTreatment may involve hospitalization for IV fluids and pain medications. Surgery may be done to control the bleeding and remove any clots, blood, or fluid in the abdomen.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nstomach bloating, pelvis pain, lower abdominal pain, being severely ill, severe abdominal pain\nUrgency:\nHospital emergency room\nAcute pancreatitis\nAcute pancreatitis is the inflammation of the pancreas, which creates and releases insulin and glucagon to keep the sugar levels in your blood stable. It also creates the enzymes that digest your food in the small intestine. When these enzymes accidentally get activated in the pancreas, they digest the pancreas itself, causing pain and inflammation.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nconstant abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, being severely ill, severe abdominal pain, fever\nSymptoms that always occur with acute pancreatitis:\nconstant abdominal pain\nUrgency:\nHospital emergency room\nAbdominal aortic aneurism (aaa) rupture\nThe aorta is the major blood highway. Injuries to the aorta can cause life-threatening internal bleeding.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nbeing severely ill, nausea, severe abdominal pain, side pain, spontaneous back pain\nSymptoms that always occur with abdominal aortic aneurism (aaa) rupture:\nbeing severely ill\nUrgency:\nEmergency medical service\nKidney stone\nA kidney stone is a stone made up of various possible materials that forms in the kidneys. Factors that increase the risk of forming kidney stones include high levels of calcium, uric acid, and oxalate in the urine, low levels of citrate in the urine, abnormal urine pH, low urine volume, certain urin...\nRead more\nSevere Abdominal Pain Treatments and Relief\nThe treatment for many causes of acute abdomen is surgery\n[5]\n. If you are stable when you arrive in the emergency room, your medical team will first do an abdominal X-ray or CT scan to get a better idea and look as to what could be causing your severe abdominal pain symptoms.\nWhen it is an emergency\nHowever, if you arrive and are unstable (symptoms of fever, shortness of breath, low blood pressure, loss of consciousness) your doctors may need to conduct urgent surgery in order to explore the possible causes of your pain whether it be obstruction, inflammation or excessive bleeding. With this exploratory surgery (also called an exploratory laparotomy), your doctors will be able to locate the severe abdominal pain cause and systematically find ways to stop it.\nFAQs About Severe Abdominal Pain\nHere are some frequently asked questions about severe abdominal pain.\nWhen should I be concerned about a stomach ache?\nYou should be concerned about abdominal pain if you are also experiencing dizziness, loss of consciousness, a rigid abdomen, or pain that worsens severely if an individual is moved. Additionally, blood in feces or vomiting, chest pain, or an indication that you might be pregnant are also concerning.\nWhy do I have severe stomach pain during my period?\nSevere stomach or abdominal pain during your period can be caused by endometriosis, a disorder in which tissue that usually lines the uterus migrates to areas beyond the uterus. This tissue grows and sloughs off in concert with the woman's menstrual period. This can cause tenderness, pain during sex, and severe abdominal pain during a period. Alternatively, an ectopic pregnancy or pregnancy in which the embryo is somewhere other than the uterus can cause pain but usually much later.\nWhy do certain foods cause severe stomach pain?\nCertain foods can cause severe stomach pain by causing stomach cramps. If you have an ulcer, foods that require vigorous motion to digest or foods that contain acid can cause severe stomach pain. Additionally, foods that are hard may also cause cramps. Foods that are high in fiber, contain large amounts of lactose, or tough meats can also cause severe stomach pain.\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Severe Abdominal Pain\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nHave you experienced any nausea?\nAny fever today or during the last week?\nHave you lost your appetite recently?\nHow would you describe the nature of your abdominal pain?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
