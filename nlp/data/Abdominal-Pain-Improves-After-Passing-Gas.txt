It is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and bowel movement issues that can be difficult to treat. Signs and symptoms of IBS are usually not severe or life-threateni...\nRead more\nIndigestion (dyspepsia)\nIndigestion, also called upset stomach, dyspepsia, or functional dyspepsia, is not a disease but a collection of very common symptoms. Note: Heartburn is a separate condition.\nCommon causes are eating too much or too rapidly; greasy or spicy foods; overdoing caffeine, alcohol, or carbonated beverages; smoking; and anxiety. Some antibiotics, pain relievers, and vitamin/mineral supplements can cause indigestion.\nThe most common symptoms are pain, discomfort, and bloating in the upper abdomen soon after eating.\nIndigestion that lasts longer than two weeks, and does not respond to simple treatment, may indicate a more serious condition. Upper abdominal pain that radiates to the jaw, neck, or arm is a medical emergency.\nDiagnosis is made through patient history and physical examination. If the symptoms began suddenly, laboratory tests on blood, breath, and stool may be ordered. Upper endoscopy or abdominal x-ray may be done.\nFor functional dyspepsia \u2013 \"ordinary\" indigestion \u2013 treatment and prevention are the same. Eating five or six smaller meals per day with lighter, simpler food; managing stress; and finding alternatives for some medications will provide relief.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nnausea, stomach bloating, dyspeptic symptoms, bloating after meals, vomiting\nSymptoms that always occur with indigestion (dyspepsia):\ndyspeptic symptoms\nSymptoms that never occur with indigestion (dyspepsia):\nvomiting (old) blood or passing tarry stools, rectal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, fever\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nNormal episode of gas\nGas in the stomach and intestines is the normal result of both swallowing and digestion. It is common to swallow some air during eating and drinking, or even while chewing gum, but most of the gas is a by-product of digestion.\nFoods that commonly produce larger amounts of gas during digestion are vegetables, beans, whole grains, and dairy products. Some artificial sweeteners have the same effect, as do carbonated sodas and beers.\nA normal amount of gas in the digestive tract is not painful, or even uncomfortable, beyond a slight temporary pressure or temporary sensation of bloating within the abdomen. These symptoms will be relieved simply by passing the gas out of the rectum, or by having a bowel movement.\nMost susceptible to excessive, or painful, amounts of gas are those with almost any digestive tract disorder. This is because normal digestion, breakdown, and absorption of food may be slowed or altered.\nIf there is no other illness, improving the diet can usually help with reducing the amount of gas produced.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nflatulence\nSymptoms that always occur with normal episode of gas:\nflatulence\nSymptoms that never occur with normal episode of gas:\ninvoluntary defecation\nUrgency:\nWait and watch\nNormal variation of constipation\nConstipation means bowel movements which have become infrequent and/or hardened and difficult to pass.\nThere is wide variation in what is thought \"normal\" when it comes to frequency of bowel movements. Anywhere from three times a day to three times a week is considered normal.\nAs long as stools are easy to pass, laxatives should not be used in an effort to force the body to a more frequent schedule.\nConstipation is usually caused by lack of fiber in the diet; not drinking enough water; insufficient exercise; and often suppressing the urge to have a bowel movement.\nA number of medications and remedies, especially narcotic pain relievers, can cause constipation.\nWomen are often affected, due to pregnancy and other hormonal changes. Young children who demand low-fiber or \"junk food\" diets are also susceptible.\nConstipation is a condition, not a disease, and most of the time is easily corrected. If simple adjustments in diet, exercise, and bowel habits don't help, a doctor can be consulted to rule out a more serious cause.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea, stomach bloating, constipation, constipation\nSymptoms that always occur with normal variation of constipation:\nconstipation\nSymptoms that never occur with normal variation of constipation:\nvomiting\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nAbdominal Pain That Improves After Passing Gas Symptom Checker\nTake a quiz to find out what might be causing your abdominal pain that improves after passing gas\nTake quiz\nFood poisoning\nFood poisoning, also called foodborne illness or \"stomach flu,\" is an acute infection of the digestive tract from food contaminated with bacteria, viruses, parasites, or other toxins. It actually has no relation to influenza.\nAny food can become contaminated if not prepared under clean conditions, cooked thoroughly, or stored at cold temperatures. Meat, fish, dairy products, and fresh fruits and vegetables are some of the most easily contaminated foods.\nSymptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and sometimes fever and chills.\nMost people recover on their own with supportive care, meaning rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers and fever reducers.\nHowever, dehydration can result if the vomiting and/or diarrhea are not controlled and IV fluids may be needed.\nIf there is also blurred vision, dizziness, or paralysis, the nervous system may be affected due to botulism. This is a medical emergency. Take the patient to the emergency room or call 9-1-1.\nProper food preparation and storage, along with frequent and thorough handwashing, is the best prevention.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nnausea, abdominal pain (stomach ache), headache, abdominal cramps (stomach cramps), dizziness\nSymptoms that never occur with food poisoning:\nsevere fever, being severely ill, bloody diarrhea\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nViral (rotavirus) infection\nRotavirus infection is a contagious gastrointestinal virus that most often affects babies, toddlers, and young children. It causes severe watery diarrhea, sometimes with vomiting and fever.\nAdults may also be infected, though usually with milder symptoms.\nRotavirus spreads very quickly when any trace of stool from an infected child contaminates food or drink, or gets onto any surface. If another child consumes the food or drink, or touches the surface and then their mouth, the child will become infected.\nRotavirus in adults does not usually need a trip to the ER unless the degree of dehydration is severe but dehydration can set in quickly in children and is a medical emergency. A child can die if not treated immediately. Take the child to an emergency room or call 9-1-1.\nTreatment consists of drinking fluids or IV fluids in severe cases and supportive care, usually in a hospital. Antibiotics will not help rotavirus because they only work against bacteria.\nThe best way prevention is frequent and thorough handwashing, as well as washing toys and surfaces when possible. There is now a vaccine that will either prevent rotavirus infection or greatly lessen the symptoms if the child still gets the virus.\nRarity:\nUltra rare\nTop Symptoms:\ndiarrhea, vomiting or nausea, nausea, fatigue, abdominal pain (stomach ache), headache\nSymptoms that always occur with viral (rotavirus) infection:\ndiarrhea, vomiting or nausea\nSymptoms that never occur with viral (rotavirus) infection:\nconstipation, tarry stool\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nConstipation from not eating enough fiber\nConstipation is defined as having stools which are large, hard, and difficult to pass. This leaves the person feeling bloated and uncomfortable. Many things can cause constipation, and a common one is lack of fiber in the diet.\nTo determine whether lack of fiber is causing the constipation, all other causes are first ruled out:\nNot drinking enough water, sometimes to the point of dehydration.\nLack of exercise, which helps increase blood circulation and therefore motility (contraction and movement) of the bowel.\nA very low or no-fat diet.\nA need for probiotics, which replenish the \"good\" bacteria in the gut.\nMedications, or certain illnesses, which have a constipating effect.\nConstantly ignoring the feeling of needing to move the bowels, and delaying going to the toilet.\nIf fiber is needed, the best sources are fresh vegetables; fresh or dried fruits; and whole wheat and brown rice, because those include the fiber-rich bran. Over-the-counter fiber tablets can be tried, though laxatives should only be used if recommended by a medical provider.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nconstipation, constipation, pain in the lower left abdomen, pain when passing stools, feeling of needing to constantly pass stool\nSymptoms that always occur with constipation from not eating enough fiber:\nconstipation, constipation\nSymptoms that never occur with constipation from not eating enough fiber:\nvomiting\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nDiverticulosis\nDiverticulosis is the common condition of small, sac-like pouches forming and pushing outward along the inside of the colon, called diverticula. With diverticulosis, there may be changes in bowel movement patterns as well as severe abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, or rectal bl...\nRead more\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Abdominal Pain That Improves After Passing Gas\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nHave you experienced any nausea?\nAny fever today or during the last week?\nHow would you describe the nature of your abdominal pain?\nHave you been feeling more tired than usual, lethargic or fatigued despite sleeping a normal amount?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
