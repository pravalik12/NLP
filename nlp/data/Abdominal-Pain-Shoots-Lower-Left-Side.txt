This list does not constitute medical advice and may not accurately represent what you have.\nNormal variation of constipation\nConstipation means bowel movements which have become infrequent and/or hardened and difficult to pass.\nThere is wide variation in what is thought \"normal\" when it comes to frequency of bowel movements. Anywhere from three times a day to three times a week is considered normal.\nAs long as stools are easy to pass, laxatives should not be used in an effort to force the body to a more frequent schedule.\nConstipation is usually caused by lack of fiber in the diet; not drinking enough water; insufficient exercise; and often suppressing the urge to have a bowel movement.\nA number of medications and remedies, especially narcotic pain relievers, can cause constipation.\nWomen are often affected, due to pregnancy and other hormonal changes. Young children who demand low-fiber or \"junk food\" diets are also susceptible.\nConstipation is a condition, not a disease, and most of the time is easily corrected. If simple adjustments in diet, exercise, and bowel habits don't help, a doctor can be consulted to rule out a more serious cause.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea, stomach bloating, constipation, constipation\nSymptoms that always occur with normal variation of constipation:\nconstipation\nSymptoms that never occur with normal variation of constipation:\nvomiting\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nIrritable bowel syndrome (ibs)\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder of the large intestine. It is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and bowel movement issues that can be difficult to treat. Signs and symptoms of IBS are usually not severe or life-threateni...\nRead more\nConstipation resulting from dehydration\nConstipation means difficulty in passing bowel movements. A common cause of constipation is dehydration, or insufficient water in the body. If the contents of the bowel are not kept full and lubricated by plenty of fluid, the waste can become dry and packed and very hard to pass.\nMost susceptible are pregnant women, especially those with a condition called hyperemesis gravidarum. This syndrome causes severe nausea and vomiting throughout most of the pregnancy and can easily lead to dehydration.\nAnyone with an illness that causes prolonged vomiting and diarrhea will soon become dehydrated. A number of prescription medications can act as diuretics, meaning they cause the body to lose extra fluid through the urine.\nThe use of alcohol, or illegal drugs such as cocaine, also has a very dehydrating effect. The ill effects called a \"hangover\" that often happen after a night of drinking are actually due to the dehydration caused by the alcohol.\nTreatment involves rehydrating, either with plain water by mouth or, in severe cases, hospitalization for IV fluid rehydration.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nconstipation, constipation, general abdominal pain, pain in the lower left abdomen, pain when passing stools\nSymptoms that always occur with constipation resulting from dehydration:\nconstipation\nSymptoms that never occur with constipation resulting from dehydration:\nvomiting\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nIntestinal inflammation (diverticulitis)\nDiverticula are small pouches that bulge outward through the colon, or large intestine. Diverticulitis is a condition where the pouches become inflamed or infected, a process which can cause fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, cramping, and constipation.\nRarity:\nUncommon\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation\nSymptoms that never occur with intestinal inflammation (diverticulitis):\npain below the ribs, pain in the upper right abdomen\nUrgency:\nHospital emergency room\nAbdominal Pain That Shoots To The Lower Left Side Symptom Checker\nTake a quiz to find out what might be causing your abdominal pain that shoots to the lower left side\nTake quiz\nKidney stone\nA kidney stone is a stone made up of various possible materials that forms in the kidneys.

However, it is possible to get PID from other causes.\nAny woman can be affected. It is most often found in sexually active women under age 25, especially those who have had PID before, have multiple partners, and/or douche frequently.\nSymptoms include fever, lower abdominal pain, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, pain and/or bleeding during sex, and pain on urination.\nUntreated PID can cause infertility due to damaged tissue in the reproductive tract, as well as chronic pelvic and abdominal pain. Unprotected sex partners will be infected as well.\nDiagnosis is made through symptoms, pelvic examination, vaginal and cervical swabs, and urine tests.\nTreatment is with a course of antibiotics. Be sure to finish all of the medication as directed, even when you begin feeling better.\nTo prevent PID, have all partners (male or female) tested for STDs and avoid unprotected sexual contact.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nfever, abdominal pain or unusual vaginal discharge, vaginal discharge, nausea or vomiting, vaginal bleeding, pelvis pain\nSymptoms that always occur with pelvic inflammatory disease:\nfever, abdominal pain or unusual vaginal discharge\nUrgency:\nIn-person visit\nOvarian cyst\nDuring her reproductive years, a woman's ovaries release a single egg cell each month. But sometimes the egg remains on the surface of the ovary, where the follicle that enclosed it continues to grow. It then becomes a fluid-filled ovarian cyst.\nOvarian cysts may be caused by hormonal imbalances; by endometriosis tissue, if it attaches to the ovary; and by severe pelvic infections that spread to the ovaries. Cysts may also form during pregnancy.\nSmall ovarian cysts often cause no symptoms. Larger cysts may cause pelvic pain, backache, unexplained weight gain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and/or pain during sex. Ovarian cysts are almost never a form of cancer.\nSudden, severe abdominal pain could indicate a ruptured cyst. This is a medical emergency and the patient should go to an emergency room or call 9-1-1.\nDiagnosis is made through ultrasound.\nHormonal birth control, such as the pill, injection, or patch, prevents ovulation and therefore prevents the formation of cysts. Surgery to remove the cyst may be necessary in some cases.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nstomach bloating, vaginal bleeding, pelvis pain, lower abdominal pain, lower back pain\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nOvarian torsion\nOvarian torsion, also called adnexal torsion or tubo-ovarian torsion, is the twisting of the \"stem,\" or supporting fleshy pedicle, of the ovary.\nThis condition can occur when a mass forms on the surface of the ovary and pulls it over. This is most often a complication of cystic ovaries.\nIt is most common in women under thirty or past menopause. It can occur during pregnancy.\nSymptoms include severe, one-sided, lower abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting.\nDiagnosis is made by ultrasound. The ovary will appear enlarged due to the torsion cutting off the circulation. There will be free pelvic fluid and a twisted pedicle.\nOvarian torsion is a medical emergency. The ovary can die due to loss of circulation, causing infection, abscess, or peritonitis. Surgery must be done to prevent tissue death and subsequent complications. In the majority of cases the affected ovary must be removed, which also removes the cyst or mass that caused the torsion.\nProper treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can help prevent at least one cause of ovarian torsion.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea or vomiting, nausea, moderate abdominal pain, loss of appetite\nSymptoms that never occur with ovarian torsion:\ndiarrhea, pain below the ribs, mild abdominal pain\nUrgency:\nHospital emergency room\nTesticular torsion\nIn torsion, the testicle is inadequately attached to the scrotum, allowing it to rotate freely within. This can lead to twisting of the testicle about the blood vessels to which it is connected, cutting off blood flow and leading to severe pain and the eventual death of the testicl...\nRead more\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Abdominal Pain That Shoots To The Lower Left Side\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nHave you experienced any nausea?\nAny fever today or during the last week?\nHave you been feeling more tired than usual, lethargic or fatigued despite sleeping a normal amount?\nHow would you describe the nature of your abdominal pain?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
