While it can occur at any age, the most commonly affected group...\nRead more\nGallstones\nGallstones are small, round deposits found in the gallbladder, the organ where bile is stored.

It is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and bowel movement issues that can be difficult to treat. Signs and symptoms of IBS are usually not severe or life-threateni...\nRead more\nNormal variation of constipation\nConstipation means bowel movements which have become infrequent and/or hardened and difficult to pass.\nThere is wide variation in what is thought \"normal\" when it comes to frequency of bowel movements. Anywhere from three times a day to three times a week is considered normal.\nAs long as stools are easy to pass, laxatives should not be used in an effort to force the body to a more frequent schedule.\nConstipation is usually caused by lack of fiber in the diet; not drinking enough water; insufficient exercise; and often suppressing the urge to have a bowel movement.\nA number of medications and remedies, especially narcotic pain relievers, can cause constipation.\nWomen are often affected, due to pregnancy and other hormonal changes. Young children who demand low-fiber or \"junk food\" diets are also susceptible.\nConstipation is a condition, not a disease, and most of the time is easily corrected. If simple adjustments in diet, exercise, and bowel habits don't help, a doctor can be consulted to rule out a more serious cause.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea, stomach bloating, constipation, constipation\nSymptoms that always occur with normal variation of constipation:\nconstipation\nSymptoms that never occur with normal variation of constipation:\nvomiting\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nGall bladder infection (cholecystitis)\nGallbladder infection, also called cholecystitis, means there is a bacterial infection of the gallbladder either with or without gallstones.\nThe gallbladder is a small organ that stores bile, which helps to digest fats. If something blocks the flow of bile out of the gallbladder \u2013 gallstones, damage to the bile ducts, or tumors in the gallbladder \u2013 the bile stagnates and bacteria multiplies in it, producing an infected gallbladder.\nRisk factors include obesity, a high-fat diet, and a family history of gallstones.\nSymptoms include fever; chills; right upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the right shoulder; and sometimes nausea and vomiting. A gallbladder infection is an acute (sudden) illness, while the symptoms of gallstones come on gradually.\nUntreated cholecystitis can lead to rupture of the gallbladder, which can be life-threatening.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination, ultrasound or other imaging, and blood tests.\nTreatment involves hospitalizing the patient for fasting with IV fluids, to rest the gallbladder; antibiotics; and pain medication. Surgery to remove the gallbladder is often done so that the condition cannot recur.\nRarity:\nUncommon\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation\nSymptoms that always occur with gall bladder infection (cholecystitis):\nabdominal pain (stomach ache)\nSymptoms that never occur with gall bladder infection (cholecystitis):\npain in the upper left abdomen, pain in the lower left abdomen\nUrgency:\nHospital emergency room\nAbdominal Pain That Shoots To The Lower Right Side Symptom Checker\nTake a quiz to find out what might be causing your abdominal pain that shoots to the lower right side\nTake quiz\nKidney stone\nA kidney stone is a stone made up of various possible materials that forms in the kidneys.

However, it is possible to get PID from other causes.\nAny woman can be affected. It is most often found in sexually active women under age 25, especially those who have had PID before, have multiple partners, and/or douche frequently.\nSymptoms include fever, lower abdominal pain, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, pain and/or bleeding during sex, and pain on urination.\nUntreated PID can cause infertility due to damaged tissue in the reproductive tract, as well as chronic pelvic and abdominal pain. Unprotected sex partners will be infected as well.\nDiagnosis is made through symptoms, pelvic examination, vaginal and cervical swabs, and urine tests.\nTreatment is with a course of antibiotics. Be sure to finish all of the medication as directed, even when you begin feeling better.\nTo prevent PID, have all partners (male or female) tested for STDs and avoid unprotected sexual contact.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nfever, abdominal pain or unusual vaginal discharge, vaginal discharge, nausea or vomiting, vaginal bleeding, pelvis pain\nSymptoms that always occur with pelvic inflammatory disease:\nfever, abdominal pain or unusual vaginal discharge\nUrgency:\nIn-person visit\nOvarian cyst\nDuring her reproductive years, a woman's ovaries release a single egg cell each month. But sometimes the egg remains on the surface of the ovary, where the follicle that enclosed it continues to grow. It then becomes a fluid-filled ovarian cyst.\nOvarian cysts may be caused by hormonal imbalances; by endometriosis tissue, if it attaches to the ovary; and by severe pelvic infections that spread to the ovaries. Cysts may also form during pregnancy.\nSmall ovarian cysts often cause no symptoms. Larger cysts may cause pelvic pain, backache, unexplained weight gain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and/or pain during sex. Ovarian cysts are almost never a form of cancer.\nSudden, severe abdominal pain could indicate a ruptured cyst. This is a medical emergency and the patient should go to an emergency room or call 9-1-1.\nDiagnosis is made through ultrasound.\nHormonal birth control, such as the pill, injection, or patch, prevents ovulation and therefore prevents the formation of cysts. Surgery to remove the cyst may be necessary in some cases.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nstomach bloating, vaginal bleeding, pelvis pain, lower abdominal pain, lower back pain\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nOvarian torsion\nOvarian torsion, also called adnexal torsion or tubo-ovarian torsion, is the twisting of the \"stem,\" or supporting fleshy pedicle, of the ovary.\nThis condition can occur when a mass forms on the surface of the ovary and pulls it over. This is most often a complication of cystic ovaries.\nIt is most common in women under thirty or past menopause. It can occur during pregnancy.\nSymptoms include severe, one-sided, lower abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting.\nDiagnosis is made by ultrasound. The ovary will appear enlarged due to the torsion cutting off the circulation. There will be free pelvic fluid and a twisted pedicle.\nOvarian torsion is a medical emergency. The ovary can die due to loss of circulation, causing infection, abscess, or peritonitis. Surgery must be done to prevent tissue death and subsequent complications. In the majority of cases the affected ovary must be removed, which also removes the cyst or mass that caused the torsion.\nProper treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can help prevent at least one cause of ovarian torsion.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea or vomiting, nausea, moderate abdominal pain, loss of appetite\nSymptoms that never occur with ovarian torsion:\ndiarrhea, pain below the ribs, mild abdominal pain\nUrgency:\nHospital emergency room\nTesticular torsion\nIn torsion, the testicle is inadequately attached to the scrotum, allowing it to rotate freely within. This can lead to twisting of the testicle about the blood vessels to which it is connected, cutting off blood flow and leading to severe pain and the eventual death of the testicl...\nRead more\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Abdominal Pain That Shoots To The Lower Right Side\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nHave you experienced any nausea?\nAny fever today or during the last week?\nHave you lost your appetite recently?\nHow would you describe the nature of your abdominal pain?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
