A lump in this area can be upsetting; however, this does not guarantee it is cause for significant concern\n[1]\n.\nCommon accompanying symptoms of a hard abdominal lump\nAn abdominal lump is often associated with the following:\nPain or discomfort:\nThis is especially\nlikely when changing positions\n.\nTenderness to the touch\nRedness\nFever\nChanges in appearance:\nThe lump may look different during activities such as standing, coughing, or straining.\nA burning or aching sensation\nLess-concerning characteristics\nNew lumps and bumps in the abdomen are also concerning since they can be the initial sign of a cancerous process. However, there are signs and symptoms that can be less worrisome. For example, a lump in the abdomen, even if it is hard, is less concerning if it possesses the following characteristics:\nEasily mobile\nReducible:\nThis means it can be pushed back into the abdomen with manual pressure.\nConcerning characteristics\nA lump in the abdomen that requires prompt follow-up have the following characteristics:\nHardness\nSignificant pain\nRigidity/feeling of being stuck in place\nGrows in size over time\nMake an appointment with your physician if you experience these symptoms in order to get appropriate treatment and counseling.\nWhat Causes a Hard Lump on the Abdomen?\nAbdominal structures\nA hard lump in the abdomen is usually the result of the collection or growth of underlying structures in the abdomen. There are various specific structures within the abdominal region including:\nMuscles:\nThe muscles of the groin are called the adductor muscles. These muscles allow you to bring your thighs together and work with other muscles in movements such as bringing the knees to the chest. Furthermore, the muscles of the abdomen also connect in this area.\nFat:\nThere is a layer of fatty tissue under the skin that stores energy, insulates/regulates the body\u2019s temperature and serves as a protective cushion.\nLymphatics:\nUnderneath the skin, there are three to five lymph nodes \u2014 structures throughout the body that play an important role in allowing the body to fight off infections\nOther conditions in the following sections can also lead to the development of a hard abdominal lump\n[1]\n.\nHernia\nA hernia occurs when part of an organ pushes through an opening or weakness in the muscles or tissues that surround it\n[2]\n. The protruding organ can result in a noticeable lump or bulge in the area. Usually, a hard lump in the abdomen is the result of the following:\nSurgical:\nA surgical incision is essentially the creation of a weakness in the abdominal wall. After surgery, the abdominal wall is closed; however, factors such as weight gain, pregnancy, or excessive activity too soon after the procedure can result in an increase in abdominal pressure and stretching of the incision before it is completely healed. This makes it easy for contents to protrude through the incision, resulting in a hernia\n[3]\n.\nDevelopmental:\nA developmental hernia, also called umbilical hernia, arises when intestinal content protrudes through the hole the umbilical cord passed through at birth\n[4]\n. This hard\nlump is located in the area of the belly button\nand is easily identifiable in newborns and small children. There are other types of hernias such as epigastric or Spigelian that can also result due to improper development of the abdominal structures\n[5]\n.\nOther causes\nOther causes that can lead to hard abdominal lumps include:\nLymphatic:\nThe lymph nodes are structures that contain immune cells that fight infection and filter harmful substances from the body. When these structures become infected, they can swell and result in palpable lumps. The abdomen contains some lymph nodes that are susceptible to infection and swelling. If swollen lymph nodes are causing the lump in your abdomen you may also experience tenderness and fever as well.\nCancerous:\nA hard lump in the abdomen, especially in the abdomen of a child, can be a sign of a cancerous condition called neuroblastoma\n[6]\n. It is very important to follow up with your physician if you notice a hard lump in that area accompanied by symptoms such as pain, weight loss or an enlarged belly\n[7]\n.\n10 Possible Hard Abdominal Lump Conditions\nThe list below shows results from the use of our quiz by Buoy users who experienced hard abdominal lump. This list does not constitute medical advice and may not accurately represent what you have.\nLipoma\nLipoma is a word that translates as \"fatty tumor,\" but a lipoma is not cancer. It is simply a growth of fat between the muscle layer and the skin above it.\nThe exact cause is not known. The condition does run in families and is associated with other unusual syndromes such as adiposis dolorosa, which is similar. Lipomas most often appear after age 40.\nSymptoms include a soft, easily moveable lump beneath the skin, about two inches across. A lipoma is painless unless its growth is irritating the nerves around it. They are most often found on the back, neck, and abdomen, and sometimes the arms and upper legs.\nIt is a good idea to have any new or unusual growth checked by a medical provider, just to make certain it is benign.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination, biopsy, and imaging such as ultrasound or CT scan.\nMost of the time, treatment is not necessary unless the lipoma is unsightly or is interfering with other structures. It can be removed through surgery or liposuction.\nRarity:\nUncommon\nTop Symptoms:\nskin-colored groin bump, marble sized groin lump, small groin lump\nSymptoms that always occur with lipoma:\nskin-colored groin bump\nUrgency:\nWait and watch\nSkin cyst\nA cyst is a small sac or lump, filled with fluid, air, fat, or other material, that begins to grow somewhere in the body for no apparent reason. A skin cyst is one that forms just beneath the skin.\nIt's believed that skin cysts form around trapped keratin cells \u2013 the cells that form the relatively tough outer layer of the skin.\nThese cysts are not contagious.\nAnyone can get a skin cyst, but they are most common in those who are over age 18, have acne, or have injured the skin.\nSymptoms include the appearance of a small, rounded lump under the skin. Cysts are normally painless unless infected, when they will be reddened and sore and contain pus.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination. A small cyst can be left alone, though if it is unsightly or large enough to interfere with movement it can be removed in a simple procedure done in a doctor's office. An infected cyst must be treated so that the infection does not spread.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nskin-colored armpit bump, marble sized armpit lump, small armpit lump\nSymptoms that always occur with skin cyst:\nskin-colored armpit bump\nUrgency:\nWait and watch\nSkin abscess\nA skin abscess is a large pocket of pus that has formed just beneath the skin. It is caused by bacteria getting under the skin, usually through a small cut or scratch, and beginning to multiply. The body fights the invasion with white blood cells, which kill some of the infected tissue but form pus within the cavity that remains.\nSymptoms include a large, red, swollen, painful lump of pus anywhere on the body beneath the skin. There may be fever, chills, and body aches from the infection.\nIf not treated, there is the risk of an abscess enlarging, spreading, and causing serious illness.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination.\nA small abscess may heal on its own, through the body's immune system. But some will need to be drained or lanced in a medical provider's office so that the pus can be cleaned out. Antibiotics are usually prescribed.\nKeeping the skin clean, and using only clean clothes and towels, will help to make sure that the abscess does not recur.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nrash with bumps or blisters, red rash, red skin bump larger than 1/2 cm in diameter, pus-filled rash, rash\nSymptoms that always occur with skin abscess:\nrash with bumps or blisters\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nOvarian cyst\nDuring her reproductive years, a woman's ovaries release a single egg cell each month. But sometimes the egg remains on the surface of the ovary, where the follicle that enclosed it continues to grow. It then becomes a fluid-filled ovarian cyst.\nOvarian cysts may be caused by hormonal imbalances; by endometriosis tissue, if it attaches to the ovary; and by severe pelvic infections that spread to the ovaries. Cysts may also form during pregnancy.\nSmall ovarian cysts often cause no symptoms. Larger cysts may cause pelvic pain, backache, unexplained weight gain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and/or pain during sex. Ovarian cysts are almost never a form of cancer.\nSudden, severe abdominal pain could indicate a ruptured cyst. This is a medical emergency and the patient should go to an emergency room or call 9-1-1.\nDiagnosis is made through ultrasound.\nHormonal birth control, such as the pill, injection, or patch, prevents ovulation and therefore prevents the formation of cysts. Surgery to remove the cyst may be necessary in some cases.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nstomach bloating, vaginal bleeding, pelvis pain, lower abdominal pain, lower back pain\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nUterine fibroids\nUterine fibroids are benign growths in the wall of the uterus and most often appear during childbearing years. Fibroids are almost never associated with cancer.\nThose at higher risk include black women and women who started their periods at a young age. Other risk factors are vitamin D deficiency, poor diet, obesity, drinking alcohol, and family history of fibroids.\nFibroids can cause pelvic pressure and pain, severe menstrual cramping, and heavy menstrual bleeding that leads to anemia. Quality of life is diminished due to the chronic pain and discomfort. Though fibroids don't always make it impossible to become pregnant, infertility and pregnancy loss may occur as well as pre-term delivery.\nFibroids can be diagnosed through a routine pelvic exam or ultrasound in a doctor's office.\nA gynecologist can prescribe various medications to ease the symptoms and regulate the menstrual cycle. There are also a number of surgical techniques, some minimally invasive, to shrink or remove the fibroids while leaving the uterus in place. Hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, is an option in some cases.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nvaginal bleeding, pelvis pain, abdominal cramps (stomach cramps), painful periods, irregular period\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nHard Abdominal Lump Symptom Checker\nTake a quiz to find out what might be causing your hard abdominal lump\nTake quiz\nStomach neoplasm\nA neoplasm, or tumor, can be benign/non-cancerous, or it can be malignant/cancer.

This neoplasm may be either benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancer.)\nThe exact cause of any cancer remains unknown. Risk factors seem to be:\nBeing over fifty years of age.\nFamily history of the disease.\nA high-fat, low-fiber diet, typical in the modern world\nChronic inflammatory diseases of the colon such as Crohn's disease.\nSmoking and alcohol use.\nDiabetes, obesity, and inactivity.\nThe earliest symptoms are usually polyps, small growths within the colon which can be detected on colonoscopy and removed before they can become cancerous. Later symptoms may be unexplained fatigue; change in bowel habits; persistent abdominal discomfort such as gas or cramps; blood in stool; or rectal bleeding.\nDiagnosis is made through colonoscopy and sometimes blood testing.\nTreatment is done through surgery, which may be minor or extensive; and through chemotherapy with radiation therapy, usually done before and after surgery. Supportive care to keep the patient comfortable is also an important part of treatment.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nfatigue, stomach bloating, stool changes, diarrhea, constipation\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nChronic myeloid leukemia (cml)\nChronic myeloid leukemia, or CML, is a rare cancer of the blood. It is also called chronic myelogenous leukemia or chronic granulocytic leukemia.\n\"Chronic\" means the condition appears gradually, over months or years. \"Myeloid\" cells normally give rise to red, white, and other blood cells but cannot function due to the cancer.\nCML is believed to have a genetic cause, though it is not hereditary.\nCML is most often seen in older male adults and rarely in children, though anyone can be affected.\nSymptoms include bleeding that is slow to clot; pain on the left side of the mid abdomen; fatigue; fever; loss of appetite; unexplained weight loss; pale skin; and night sweats.\nIt is important to see a medical provider with these symptoms, for the disease responds best when treated early.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination, blood tests, and bone marrow tests.\nTreatment most often involves therapy with specialized, \"targeted\" drugs. Other treatments are chemotherapy; therapy to strengthen the immune system; and sometimes a blood stem cell transplant.\nRarity:\nUltra rare\nTop Symptoms:\nfatigue, stomach bloating, shortness of breath, unintentional weight loss, feeling of fullness early in a meal\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nCancer of fat cells\nLiposarcoma is a type of cancer characterized by tumors growing in fatty tissues. This cancer can occur in any part of the body, but most often involves the thigh or the belly (abdomen).\nRarity:\nUltra rare\nTop Symptoms:\nfatigue, unintentional weight loss, abdominal bump, hard palpable mass, painless abdominal lump\nSymptoms that always occur with cancer of fat cells:\nlump below the skin on the chest\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nWhen and How to Treat a Hard Lump on the Stomach\nWhen to see a doctor\nSince the causes of hard abdominal lumps are varied, it is important to make an appointment with your physician in order to get the proper diagnosis and treatment. Depending on the cause of your symptoms, your physician may suggest:\nSurgery:\nIf an incisional or an umbilical hernia is causing your hard abdominal lump, your physician may suggest open or non-invasive surgery to relieve discomfort and prevent complications. However, if your hernia is not causing you significant pain or discomfort, your physician may suggest watchful waiting.\nAntibiotics:\nIf you have swollen lymph nodes due to infection, your physician will provide appropriate antibiotic treatment.\nCancer treatment:\nIf your hard abdominal lump and associated symptoms are due to cancer, your physician will discuss treatment options including surgery, radiation or chemotherapy.\nWhen it is an emergency\nSeek immediate treatment in an emergency room or call 911 if the following occur:\nNausea\nand/or\nvomiting\nFever\nPain that is sudden and increases in intensity\nLump changes color\nInability to pass gas\nThese could be signs of an incarcerated hernia. A hernia is incarcerated when it becomes trapped in the abdominal wall. Incarcerated hernias are dangerous because they can wrap around themselves and cut off blood flow to the trapped tissue. When this occurs, a strangulated hernia results, which can have life-threatening consequences if not treated promptly.\nFAQs About Hard Abdominal Lump\nWhy can my hard abdominal lump be moved/pushed back into my abdomen sometimes?\nThis phenomenon is called reducibility. Often the protrusion of contents can be easily pushed back into the opening or weakness, signaling that the lump can be fixed or treated by properly closing the hole. Often reduction of the lump can help alleviate associated symptoms and delay the need for surgery.\nWill a hard abdominal lump affect my digestion?\nDepending on the cause of your hard abdominal lump, your digestion may be affected. In the case of cancer, a growth may block the flow of food and affect digestion as well as cause symptoms such as pain, nausea, and vomiting. However, in the case of conditions such as incisional or umbilical hernias, the digestion is not usually affected.\nCan I still exercise with a hard abdominal lump?\nExercise is acceptable if you take precautions to avoid aggravating the abdominal tissues or increasing intra-abdominal pressure. Low-intensity or low-impact exercises such as dancing, walking or water aerobics may be good options. However, activities such as heavy weightlifting can cause strain in that area and increase pressure in the abdomen causing the lump to bulge unnecessarily. Always speak with your physician before beginning an exercise regimen.\nAfter repairing my abdominal lump, when can I start exercise?\nWhen you can resume exercise and other physical activity will depend on the size of your lump and the type of repair that was performed. However, most people can return to their normal level of physical activity after four to six weeks.\nCan a hard abdominal lump be inherited?\nSome abdominal lumps related to cancerous processes can be inherited. For example, the mutation that causes some forms of neuroblastoma in children can be inherited. However, for conditions such as surgical or developmental hernias, there is no hereditary component.\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Hard Abdominal Lump\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nWhat color is the bump?\nHow would you describe the location of your abdominal lump/bump the best?\nDo you feel pain when you touch the bump?\nDo you have a rash?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
