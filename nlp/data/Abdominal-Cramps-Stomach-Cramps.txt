Or, maybe you just started a new medication and are feeling a bit off.\nWe often refer to belly (or abdominal) pain as stomach cramps; however, the discomfort can also be due to irritation of the surrounding organs like the intestines. It's typical to experience symptoms around mealtime even though there are a variety of other factors that may be at work. Let's first examine some of the symptoms you may be experiencing.\nCommon accompanying symptoms of stomach cramps\nYour stomach cramps can likely be described by:\nPain in your belly\nFeeling bloated\nPassing gas\nor burping\nA burning sensation\nDecreased appetite\nNausea\nAssociated\ndiarrhea\nWhat Are the Causes of Stomach Pain?\nIn many cases, certain foods or changes in diet are to blame\n[1]\n. Infections are another common cause and can spread between people. In other situations, the problem is with the stomach and gastrointestinal organs themselves. Sometimes, unfortunately, the cause remains unknown. You can learn more about what may be causing your stomach cramps in the following sections.\nDietary stomach cramps causes\nCauses of stomach cramps may be related to your eating habits, especially if you change them suddenly.\nOvereating:\nIf you overeat, your stomach will be forced to stretch to accommodate a higher volume of food.\nSpicy or oily foods:\nEating new or rich dishes that your digestive system isn't used to can cause stomach discomfort.\nDairy products:\nSome people's bodies are not able to break down dairy products like milk, yogurt, or ice cream.\nGluten:\nThis is a type of protein found in grains like wheat and barley that should be avoided by people with Celiac Disease\n[2]\n.\nGastrointestinal stomach cramps causes\nYou may experience stomach cramps directly related to the functioning of your gastrointestinal system.\nGas:\nYou may feel relief from uncomfortable bloating caused by gas when it leaves your body.\nConstipation\n:\nWithout regular bowel movements, you can quickly feel backed up and as if your stomach is distended or sticking out.\nStomach ulcers:\nThese painful sores in the lining of the stomach, also known as peptic ulcers, are often caused by bacteria\n[3]\n.\nFunctional abdominal pain:\nThis is a common kind of pain that is not caused by a physical problem with the organs in the belly. This condition is also known as centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CAPS), and treatment options are mainly supportive\n[3]\n.\nInflammatory bowel disease:\nExcess inflammation in your intestines is painful and may come with joint pains or rashes and often diarrhea or bowel movements with blood.\nInfectious stomach cramps causes\nYou may be experiencing stomach cramps due to an infection.\nViral infections:\nMost contagious cases of stomach cramps are caused by viruses and result in\nvomiting\nor diarrhea. They are especially common in children\n[4]\n.\nFood poisoning:\nSpoiled or contaminated food can contain bacteria that make you feel sick. Be wary of food that has not been refrigerated or is past the expiration date.\nOther stomach cramps causes\nOther causes that can result in stomach cramps include the following.\nAnxiety\n:\nFrequent worry takes a physical toll on the body and proper treatment from a professional goes a long way in relieving symptoms\n[5]\n.\nMedications:\nCertain drugs like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve) can be harsh on the stomach, especially when taken without food. There are suggestions to keep in mind when taking these medications to avoid abdominal cramps\n[6]\n.\nMenstrual pain:\nWomen can experience stomach cramps as a regular part of the menstrual cycle.\n10 Possible Abdominal Cramps (Stomach Cramps) Conditions\nThe list below shows results from the use of our quiz by Buoy users who experienced abdominal cramps (stomach cramps). This list does not constitute medical advice and may not accurately represent what you have.\nMenstrual cramps\nMenstrual cramps, also called dysmenorrhea, are actually contractions of the uterus as it expels its lining during a woman's monthly period.\nA certain amount of mild cramping is normal, triggered by hormone-like substances called prostaglandins. However, painful cramps may be caused by underlying conditions such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, high prostaglandin levels, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID.)\nSevere cramping may be present, as well as nausea, headache, and dull pain that radiates to the low back and thighs. It is most common in women under age 30 who smoke, have heavy and irregular periods, and have never given birth.\nAn obstetrician/gynecologist (women's specialist) can do tests for underlying conditions such as those mentioned above. Women over age 25 who suddenly begin having severe cramps should see a doctor to rule out the sudden onset of a more serious concern.\nTreatment of mild cramping can be done with heating pads to the abdomen and with over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen. Birth control pills, which regulate the menstrual cycle, are often effective in lessening cramps.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), abdominal cramps (stomach cramps), painful periods, lower back pain, abdominal pain that shoots to the back\nSymptoms that always occur with menstrual cramps:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache)\nSymptoms that never occur with menstrual cramps:\nbeing severely ill, disapearance of periods for over a year\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nViral (norovirus) infection\nIf you ever heard of an entire cruise ship of people coming down with the same \u201cstomach bug,\u201d chances are that was norovirus. Fortunately, norovirus usually goes away on its own after a few days, but is pretty unpleasant and can spread extremely easily.

The pain occurs when the follicle ruptures and releases the egg.\nThis is a dull, cramping sensation that may begin suddenly in only one side of the lower abdomen. In a few cases, there may be vaginal spotting. Mittelschmerz occurs about 14 days before the start of the next menstrual period.\nActual Mittelschmerz is not associated with nausea, vomiting, fever, or severe pelvic pain. These symptoms should be evaluated by a medical provider since they can indicate a more serious condition.\nDiagnosis is made through patient history.\nTreatment requires only over-the-counter, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve the pain. An oral contraceptive will stop the symptoms, since it also stops ovulation.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), last period approximately 2 weeks ago, vaginal bleeding, bloody vaginal discharge, pelvis pain\nSymptoms that always occur with ovulation pain (mittelschmerz) or midcycle spotting:\nlast period approximately 2 weeks ago\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nIrritable bowel syndrome (ibs)\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder of the large intestine.

It actually has no relation to influenza.\nAny food can become contaminated if not prepared under clean conditions, cooked thoroughly, or stored at cold temperatures. Meat, fish, dairy products, and fresh fruits and vegetables are some of the most easily contaminated foods.\nSymptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and sometimes fever and chills.\nMost people recover on their own with supportive care, meaning rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers and fever reducers.\nHowever, dehydration can result if the vomiting and/or diarrhea are not controlled and IV fluids may be needed.\nIf there is also blurred vision, dizziness, or paralysis, the nervous system may be affected due to botulism. This is a medical emergency. Take the patient to the emergency room or call 9-1-1.\nProper food preparation and storage, along with frequent and thorough handwashing, is the best prevention.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nnausea, abdominal pain (stomach ache), headache, abdominal cramps (stomach cramps), dizziness\nSymptoms that never occur with food poisoning:\nsevere fever, being severely ill, bloody diarrhea\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nPremenstrual syndrome\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a condition that can produce emotional and physical symptoms in women in the days leading up to their menstrual cycle.

It is characterized by difficulty passing stool, or passing stool less often. Commonly it is linked to not eating enough dietary fiber, not drinking enough fluids, or not getting enough exercise. Some medications can cause constipation as well.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nstomach bloating, constipation, abdominal cramps (stomach cramps), pain when passing stools, rectal bleeding\nSymptoms that always occur with chronic constipation:\nconstipation\nSymptoms that never occur with chronic constipation:\nunintentional weight loss\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nOvarian torsion\nOvarian torsion, also called adnexal torsion or tubo-ovarian torsion, is the twisting of the \"stem,\" or supporting fleshy pedicle, of the ovary.\nThis condition can occur when a mass forms on the surface of the ovary and pulls it over. This is most often a complication of cystic ovaries.\nIt is most common in women under thirty or past menopause. It can occur during pregnancy.\nSymptoms include severe, one-sided, lower abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting.\nDiagnosis is made by ultrasound. The ovary will appear enlarged due to the torsion cutting off the circulation. There will be free pelvic fluid and a twisted pedicle.\nOvarian torsion is a medical emergency. The ovary can die due to loss of circulation, causing infection, abscess, or peritonitis. Surgery must be done to prevent tissue death and subsequent complications. In the majority of cases the affected ovary must be removed, which also removes the cyst or mass that caused the torsion.\nProper treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can help prevent at least one cause of ovarian torsion.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea or vomiting, nausea, moderate abdominal pain, loss of appetite\nSymptoms that never occur with ovarian torsion:\ndiarrhea, pain below the ribs, mild abdominal pain\nUrgency:\nHospital emergency room\nNew onset crohn\n'\ns disease\nCrohn's disease is an inflammation of the bowel. It is caused by a faulty immune system response which makes the body attack the lining of the intestines.\nThe disease usually appears before age thirty and can affect anyone. Those with a family history may be most susceptible. Smoking is a known risk factor.\nAggravating factors include stress, poor diet, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and aspirin.\nEarly symptoms usually develop gradually, but can appear suddenly. These include fatigue, loss of appetite, fever, mouth sores, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and blood in stool.\nUntreated Crohn's disease can cause ulcers throughout the digestive tract as well as bowel obstruction, malnutrition, and deteriorating general health.\nDiagnosis is made through blood test and stool sample test. Colonoscopy, CT scan, MRI, endoscopy, and/or enteroscopy may also be used.\nCrohn's disease cannot be cured, but can be managed through reducing the inflammation. Antibiotics, corticosteroids, and immune system suppressors may be tried. Excellent nutrition, vitamin supplements, smoking cessation, and reduction in stress can be helpful.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nfatigue, stomach bloating, loss of appetite, constipation, abdominal cramps (stomach cramps)\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nHow to Treat Abdominal Cramps\nEven though stomach cramps can be frustrating, there are plenty of treatment options available that can begin at home.\nPrevention\nMany causes of stomach cramps will resolve on their own after just a few hours; however, keeping the following in mind may help you prevent them in the first place.\nSlow down at mealtime:\nIf you tend to overeat, try having smaller meals, eating more slowly, and taking time to chew carefully. There are many benefits to chewing slowly\n[7]\n.\nEat with caution:\nIf you're trying new or spicy food, go slow and don't be afraid to pass on certain options.\nAvoid common offenders:\nIf you can't tolerate dairy or gluten, you should avoid these ingredients and be sure to check food labels carefully. Fortunately, foods are increasingly well-marked with common allergens.\nAt-home treatments\nTaking more medications or supplements may actually exacerbate your stomach cramps. Try the following methods first.\nHeat:\nMany people find gentle heat from a heating pad or hot water bottle to be soothing\n[8]\n.\nMassage:\nMassaging the belly for a few minutes can sometimes do the trick as well, especially in children\n[9]\n.\nFurther treatments\nIf you are not finding relief and your stomach cramps are persisting, you can try the following, often available over-the-counter.\nGas-reliever:\nOver-the-counter drugs like simethicone\n[10]\nare best for cramps with gas.\nAntacids:\nPepto-Bismol, Tums, Zantac, and Pepcid can soothe the stomach.\nLaxative or stool softener:\nIf you're feeling constipated\n[11]\n, try Colace to soften stool and a stimulant laxative such as senna or Miralax to get things moving.\nAnti-diarrheal:\nOn the other end of the spectrum, loperamide relieves diarrhea that may be associated with cramps\n[12]\n.\nAntibiotics:\nThis prescription option is only required if your doctor suspects a bacterial infection.\nWhen to see a doctor\nIf you've recently started or changed your medication and have developed stomach cramps, it's best to talk with your doctor so this can be addressed\n[13]\n.

Stomach pain is worrisome if it is accompanied by vaginal bleeding\n[15]\n, dizziness, clamminess, fever, or fainting.\nWhat causes stomach cramps after eating?\nStomach cramps after eating can be caused by stretching of the stomach after a prolonged fast, a particularly large amount of food, a rapid change in the pH (or acidity) of the stomach\n[15]\n, or ingestion of any number of toxins. It is most commonly a benign condition that resolves with time.\nWhat causes stomach cramps and diarrhea?\nDiarrhea is caused by either inadequate absorption of liquid by the intestines, causing watery stool, or hyperactivity of the stomach and intestines giving insufficient time for absorption of nutrients within the bowels. Essentially, food moves through the bowels too fast due to increased activity of both the stomach and the intestines\n[16]\n.\nCan you experience stomach cramps from menstruation?\nYes, it is possible to experience stomach cramps accompanying menstruation. During menstruation, prostaglandins \u2014 chemicals associated with female fertility \u2014 are released\n[17]\n. This chemical can cause non-rhythmic contractions of the uterus at a low frequency. When the uterus contracts, it can squeeze out blood and block return blood flow. This lack of blood flow can cause the sensation of a cramp\n[18]\n.\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Abdominal Cramps (Stomach Cramps)\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nHave you experienced any nausea?\nAny fever today or during the last week?\nHave you been feeling more tired than usual, lethargic or fatigued despite sleeping a normal amount?\nHave you lost your appetite recently?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
