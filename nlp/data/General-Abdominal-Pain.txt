It is caused by a faulty immune system response which makes the body attack the lining of the intestines.\nThe disease usually appears before age thirty and can affect anyone. Those with a family history may be most susceptible. Smoking is a known risk factor.\nAggravating factors include stress, poor diet, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and aspirin.\nEarly symptoms usually develop gradually, but can appear suddenly. These include fatigue, loss of appetite, fever, mouth sores, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and blood in stool.\nUntreated Crohn's disease can cause ulcers throughout the digestive tract as well as bowel obstruction, malnutrition, and deteriorating general health.\nDiagnosis is made through blood test and stool sample test. Colonoscopy, CT scan, MRI, endoscopy, and/or enteroscopy may also be used.\nCrohn's disease cannot be cured, but can be managed through reducing the inflammation. Antibiotics, corticosteroids, and immune system suppressors may be tried. Excellent nutrition, vitamin supplements, smoking cessation, and reduction in stress can be helpful.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nfatigue, stomach bloating, loss of appetite, constipation, abdominal cramps (stomach cramps)\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About General Abdominal Pain\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nHave you experienced any nausea?\nAny fever today or during the last week?\nHave you lost your appetite recently?\nHave you been feeling more tired than usual, lethargic or fatigued despite sleeping a normal amount?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
