This list does not constitute medical advice and may not accurately represent what you have.\nPimple\nPimples are also called comedones, spots, blemishes, or \"zits.\" Medically, they are small skin eruptions filled with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria.\nPimples often first start appearing at puberty, when hormones increase the production of oil in the skin and sometimes clog the pores.\nMost susceptible are teenagers from about ages 13 to 17.\nSymptoms include blocked pores that may appear flat and black on the surface, because the oil darkens when exposed to the air; blocked pores that appear white on the surface because they have closed over with dead skin cells; or swollen, yellow-white, pus-filled blisters surrounded by reddened skin.\nOutbreaks of pimples on the skin can interfere with quality of life, making the person self-conscious about their appearance and causing pain and discomfort in the skin. A medical provider can help to manage the condition, sometimes through referral to a dermatologist.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination.\nTreatment involves improving diet; keeping the skin, hair, washcloths, and towels very clean; and using over-the-counter acne remedies.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\npink or red facial bump, small facial lump, painful facial bump, marble sized facial lump\nSymptoms that always occur with pimple:\npink or red facial bump\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nBoil (furuncle)\nA furuncle, also called a boil, is infection of a hair follicle. The infection forms under the skin at the root of the hair and may occur anywhere on the body.\nThe infection is caused by bacteria, most often Staphylococcus aureus or \"staph.\" Irritation caused by clothes or anything else rubbing the skin can cause the skin to break down and allow bacteria to enter.\nStaph bacteria are found everywhere. Frequent and thorough handwashing, and otherwise maintaining cleanliness, will help to prevent its spread.\nMost susceptible are those with a weakened immune system; diabetes; and other skin infections.\nSymptoms include a single bump under the skin that is swollen, painful, and red, and contains pus.\nIt is important to treat the boil, since infection can spread into the bloodstream and travel throughout the body.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination and sometimes fluid sample from the boil.\nTreatment may involve incision and drainage of the infection, followed by creams to apply to the site of the boil and/or a course of antibiotic medicine.\nRarity:\nUncommon\nTop Symptoms:\npink or red facial bump, small facial lump, painful facial bump, marble sized facial lump, constant skin changes\nSymptoms that always occur with boil (furuncle):\npink or red facial bump\nSymptoms that never occur with boil (furuncle):\nfever\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nSkin abscess\nA skin abscess is a large pocket of pus that has formed just beneath the skin. It is caused by bacteria getting under the skin, usually through a small cut or scratch, and beginning to multiply. The body fights the invasion with white blood cells, which kill some of the infected tissue but form pus within the cavity that remains.\nSymptoms include a large, red, swollen, painful lump of pus anywhere on the body beneath the skin. There may be fever, chills, and body aches from the infection.\nIf not treated, there is the risk of an abscess enlarging, spreading, and causing serious illness.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination.\nA small abscess may heal on its own, through the body's immune system. But some will need to be drained or lanced in a medical provider's office so that the pus can be cleaned out. Antibiotics are usually prescribed.\nKeeping the skin clean, and using only clean clothes and towels, will help to make sure that the abscess does not recur.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nrash with bumps or blisters, red rash, red skin bump larger than 1/2 cm in diameter, pus-filled rash, rash\nSymptoms that always occur with skin abscess:\nrash with bumps or blisters\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nDermatofibroma\nA dermatofibroma is a common skin growth that usually appears on the lower legs, but may appear anywhere on the body.
