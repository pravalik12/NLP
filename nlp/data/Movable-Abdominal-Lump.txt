A skin cyst is one that forms just beneath the skin.\nIt's believed that skin cysts form around trapped keratin cells \u2013 the cells that form the relatively tough outer layer of the skin.\nThese cysts are not contagious.\nAnyone can get a skin cyst, but they are most common in those who are over age 18, have acne, or have injured the skin.\nSymptoms include the appearance of a small, rounded lump under the skin. Cysts are normally painless unless infected, when they will be reddened and sore and contain pus.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination. A small cyst can be left alone, though if it is unsightly or large enough to interfere with movement it can be removed in a simple procedure done in a doctor's office. An infected cyst must be treated so that the infection does not spread.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nskin-colored armpit bump, marble sized armpit lump, small armpit lump\nSymptoms that always occur with skin cyst:\nskin-colored armpit bump\nUrgency:\nWait and watch\nLipoma\nLipoma is a word that translates as \"fatty tumor,\" but a lipoma is not cancer. It is simply a growth of fat between the muscle layer and the skin above it.\nThe exact cause is not known. The condition does run in families and is associated with other unusual syndromes such as adiposis dolorosa, which is similar. Lipomas most often appear after age 40.\nSymptoms include a soft, easily moveable lump beneath the skin, about two inches across. A lipoma is painless unless its growth is irritating the nerves around it. They are most often found on the back, neck, and abdomen, and sometimes the arms and upper legs.\nIt is a good idea to have any new or unusual growth checked by a medical provider, just to make certain it is benign.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination, biopsy, and imaging such as ultrasound or CT scan.\nMost of the time, treatment is not necessary unless the lipoma is unsightly or is interfering with other structures. It can be removed through surgery or liposuction.\nRarity:\nUncommon\nTop Symptoms:\nskin-colored groin bump, marble sized groin lump, small groin lump\nSymptoms that always occur with lipoma:\nskin-colored groin bump\nUrgency:\nWait and watch\nMovable Abdominal Lump Symptom Checker\nTake a quiz to find out what might be causing your movable abdominal lump\nTake quiz\nDermatofibroma\nA dermatofibroma is a common skin growth that usually appears on the lower legs, but may appear anywhere on the body.

But sometimes the egg remains on the surface of the ovary, where the follicle that enclosed it continues to grow. It then becomes a fluid-filled ovarian cyst.\nOvarian cysts may be caused by hormonal imbalances; by endometriosis tissue, if it attaches to the ovary; and by severe pelvic infections that spread to the ovaries. Cysts may also form during pregnancy.\nSmall ovarian cysts often cause no symptoms. Larger cysts may cause pelvic pain, backache, unexplained weight gain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and/or pain during sex. Ovarian cysts are almost never a form of cancer.\nSudden, severe abdominal pain could indicate a ruptured cyst. This is a medical emergency and the patient should go to an emergency room or call 9-1-1.\nDiagnosis is made through ultrasound.\nHormonal birth control, such as the pill, injection, or patch, prevents ovulation and therefore prevents the formation of cysts. Surgery to remove the cyst may be necessary in some cases.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nstomach bloating, vaginal bleeding, pelvis pain, lower abdominal pain, lower back pain\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Movable Abdominal Lump\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nWhat color is the bump?\nHow would you describe the location of your abdominal lump/bump the best?\nDo you feel pain when you touch the bump?\nDo you have a rash?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
