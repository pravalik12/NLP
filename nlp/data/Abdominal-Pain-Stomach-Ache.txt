In other cases, immediate medical attention is necessary. You should find some comfort in knowing that abdominal pain symptoms are common. Most abdominal pain symptoms are temporary and only last a few hours. These symptoms are typically related to improper food consumption \u2014 like eating too many hot dogs in one sitting \u2014 and indigestion\n[1]\n.\nCommon characteristics of stomach pain\nAbdominal pains can feel like cramps in the belly region.

For example,\nlower abdominal pain\nmay indicate appendicitis\n[2]\nor an obstruction.

Some antibiotics, pain relievers, and vitamin/mineral supplements can cause indigestion.\nThe most common symptoms are pain, discomfort, and bloating in the upper abdomen soon after eating.\nIndigestion that lasts longer than two weeks, and does not respond to simple treatment, may indicate a more serious condition. Upper abdominal pain that radiates to the jaw, neck, or arm is a medical emergency.\nDiagnosis is made through patient history and physical examination. If the symptoms began suddenly, laboratory tests on blood, breath, and stool may be ordered. Upper endoscopy or abdominal x-ray may be done.\nFor functional dyspepsia \u2013 \"ordinary\" indigestion \u2013 treatment and prevention are the same.

However, painful cramps may be caused by underlying conditions such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, high prostaglandin levels, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID.)\nSevere cramping may be present, as well as nausea, headache, and dull pain that radiates to the low back and thighs. It is most common in women under age 30 who smoke, have heavy and irregular periods, and have never given birth.\nAn obstetrician/gynecologist (women's specialist) can do tests for underlying conditions such as those mentioned above. Women over age 25 who suddenly begin having severe cramps should see a doctor to rule out the sudden onset of a more serious concern.\nTreatment of mild cramping can be done with heating pads to the abdomen and with over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen.

Anywhere from three times a day to three times a week is considered normal.\nAs long as stools are easy to pass, laxatives should not be used in an effort to force the body to a more frequent schedule.\nConstipation is usually caused by lack of fiber in the diet; not drinking enough water; insufficient exercise; and often suppressing the urge to have a bowel movement.\nA number of medications and remedies, especially narcotic pain relievers, can cause constipation.\nWomen are often affected, due to pregnancy and other hormonal changes. Young children who demand low-fiber or \"junk food\" diets are also susceptible.\nConstipation is a condition, not a disease, and most of the time is easily corrected.

Indigestion due to a large meal, a lack of food, or gas are the most common reasons. The most common pathologic reasons is a \"stomach bug\" or an infection of the stomach that usually resolves in seven to 10 days. If your stomach pain does not resolve, you should visit a healthcare provider for an evaluation.\nWhy does the top of my stomach hurt?\nThe top of your stomach may hurt because of heartburn or reflux of stomach acid into the bottom portion of the esophagus. The stomach is divided into different regions. The top of the stomach is called the \"cardia\" and this region connects to the esophagus, the tube that food travels through. The cardia can cause pain when stomach acid splashes up through the opening between the esophagus and stomach and burns the lower end of the esophagus.\nWhat causes sharp pain in the stomach?\nSharp pain in the stomach can be caused by indigestion, stomach or intestinal infection, ulcer, or a stomach tumor. Indigestion and stomach infections usually self-resolve and are much more common. Many sharp stomach pains are benign, and if they happen infrequently, they can be ignored. \"Infrequently\" is considered not frequently enough to be remembered. Additionally, sharp pains may also come from intense muscle contractions associated with vomiting. However, in this case, it is best to treat the cause of vomiting as the sharp pains will diminish as vomiting stops.\nWhat causes pain in the lower abdomen?\nPain in the lower abdomen can be caused by problems with the descending colon, rectum, or genitalia. To determine the cause of pain in the lower abdomen, it is important to recall what activities have occurred recently. Have you been constipated? Have you had trouble urinating? Have you been sick in any way recently? Have you eaten anything unusual or taken any prescribed or illicit drugs recently? Pain in the lower abdomen is commonly caused by stretching or tension placed on organs. Whether muscle contractions during an upset stomach, stretching of bowel from constipation, or an overfull bladder pressing on other organs, lower abdominal pain is commonly caused by stretching of an organ irritating a nerve. The other common cause of lower abdominal pain is inflammation which can occur in the setting of infection or, more rarely, malignancy.\nWhy does my stomach hurt after I eat?\nYour stomach may hurt after you eat if you haven't eaten in a long time, if you've eaten a particularly large meal, or if you have an ulcer, tumor, or other mass that is not protected from stomach acid by mucus within the stomach. Stomach pain after eating is most commonly caused by the normal contractions/motions of the stomach as it churns and breaks down food with stomach acid. If you have damage to the stomach or a mass of some sort, these motions can aggravate that point of tenderness causing additional stomach pain. Gas is also a common cause of stomach pain after eating. An antacid or fizzy drink may help you belch, releasing the gas and discomfort.\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Abdominal Pain (Stomach Ache)\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nHave you experienced any nausea?\nAny fever today or during the last week?\nHow would you describe the nature of your abdominal pain?\nHave you been feeling more tired than usual, lethargic or fatigued despite sleeping a normal amount?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
