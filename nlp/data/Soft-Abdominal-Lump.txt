This list does not constitute medical advice and may not accurately represent what you have.\nSkin cyst\nA cyst is a small sac or lump, filled with fluid, air, fat, or other material, that begins to grow somewhere in the body for no apparent reason. A skin cyst is one that forms just beneath the skin.\nIt's believed that skin cysts form around trapped keratin cells \u2013 the cells that form the relatively tough outer layer of the skin.\nThese cysts are not contagious.\nAnyone can get a skin cyst, but they are most common in those who are over age 18, have acne, or have injured the skin.\nSymptoms include the appearance of a small, rounded lump under the skin. Cysts are normally painless unless infected, when they will be reddened and sore and contain pus.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination. A small cyst can be left alone, though if it is unsightly or large enough to interfere with movement it can be removed in a simple procedure done in a doctor's office. An infected cyst must be treated so that the infection does not spread.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nskin-colored armpit bump, marble sized armpit lump, small armpit lump\nSymptoms that always occur with skin cyst:\nskin-colored armpit bump\nUrgency:\nWait and watch\nLipoma\nLipoma is a word that translates as \"fatty tumor,\" but a lipoma is not cancer. It is simply a growth of fat between the muscle layer and the skin above it.\nThe exact cause is not known. The condition does run in families and is associated with other unusual syndromes such as adiposis dolorosa, which is similar. Lipomas most often appear after age 40.\nSymptoms include a soft, easily moveable lump beneath the skin, about two inches across. A lipoma is painless unless its growth is irritating the nerves around it. They are most often found on the back, neck, and abdomen, and sometimes the arms and upper legs.\nIt is a good idea to have any new or unusual growth checked by a medical provider, just to make certain it is benign.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination, biopsy, and imaging such as ultrasound or CT scan.\nMost of the time, treatment is not necessary unless the lipoma is unsightly or is interfering with other structures. It can be removed through surgery or liposuction.\nRarity:\nUncommon\nTop Symptoms:\nskin-colored groin bump, marble sized groin lump, small groin lump\nSymptoms that always occur with lipoma:\nskin-colored groin bump\nUrgency:\nWait and watch\nSoft Abdominal Lump Symptom Checker\nTake a quiz to find out what might be causing your soft abdominal lump\nTake quiz\nSkin abscess\nA skin abscess is a large pocket of pus that has formed just beneath the skin. It is caused by bacteria getting under the skin, usually through a small cut or scratch, and beginning to multiply. The body fights the invasion with white blood cells, which kill some of the infected tissue but form pus within the cavity that remains.\nSymptoms include a large, red, swollen, painful lump of pus anywhere on the body beneath the skin. There may be fever, chills, and body aches from the infection.\nIf not treated, there is the risk of an abscess enlarging, spreading, and causing serious illness.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination.\nA small abscess may heal on its own, through the body's immune system. But some will need to be drained or lanced in a medical provider's office so that the pus can be cleaned out. Antibiotics are usually prescribed.\nKeeping the skin clean, and using only clean clothes and towels, will help to make sure that the abscess does not recur.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nrash with bumps or blisters, red rash, red skin bump larger than 1/2 cm in diameter, pus-filled rash, rash\nSymptoms that always occur with skin abscess:\nrash with bumps or blisters\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nOvarian cyst\nDuring her reproductive years, a woman's ovaries release a single egg cell each month. But sometimes the egg remains on the surface of the ovary, where the follicle that enclosed it continues to grow. It then becomes a fluid-filled ovarian cyst.\nOvarian cysts may be caused by hormonal imbalances; by endometriosis tissue, if it attaches to the ovary; and by severe pelvic infections that spread to the ovaries. Cysts may also form during pregnancy.\nSmall ovarian cysts often cause no symptoms. Larger cysts may cause pelvic pain, backache, unexplained weight gain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and/or pain during sex. Ovarian cysts are almost never a form of cancer.\nSudden, severe abdominal pain could indicate a ruptured cyst. This is a medical emergency and the patient should go to an emergency room or call 9-1-1.\nDiagnosis is made through ultrasound.\nHormonal birth control, such as the pill, injection, or patch, prevents ovulation and therefore prevents the formation of cysts. Surgery to remove the cyst may be necessary in some cases.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nstomach bloating, vaginal bleeding, pelvis pain, lower abdominal pain, lower back pain\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nUterine fibroids\nUterine fibroids are benign growths in the wall of the uterus and most often appear during childbearing years. Fibroids are almost never associated with cancer.\nThose at higher risk include black women and women who started their periods at a young age. Other risk factors are vitamin D deficiency, poor diet, obesity, drinking alcohol, and family history of fibroids.\nFibroids can cause pelvic pressure and pain, severe menstrual cramping, and heavy menstrual bleeding that leads to anemia. Quality of life is diminished due to the chronic pain and discomfort. Though fibroids don't always make it impossible to become pregnant, infertility and pregnancy loss may occur as well as pre-term delivery.\nFibroids can be diagnosed through a routine pelvic exam or ultrasound in a doctor's office.\nA gynecologist can prescribe various medications to ease the symptoms and regulate the menstrual cycle. There are also a number of surgical techniques, some minimally invasive, to shrink or remove the fibroids while leaving the uterus in place. Hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, is an option in some cases.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nvaginal bleeding, pelvis pain, abdominal cramps (stomach cramps), painful periods, irregular period\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Soft Abdominal Lump\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nHow would you describe the location of your abdominal lump/bump the best?\nWhat color is the bump?\nDo you feel pain when you touch the bump?\nDo you have a rash?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
