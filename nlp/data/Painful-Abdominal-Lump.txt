This list does not constitute medical advice and may not accurately represent what you have.\nUterine fibroids\nUterine fibroids are benign growths in the wall of the uterus and most often appear during childbearing years. Fibroids are almost never associated with cancer.\nThose at higher risk include black women and women who started their periods at a young age. Other risk factors are vitamin D deficiency, poor diet, obesity, drinking alcohol, and family history of fibroids.\nFibroids can cause pelvic pressure and pain, severe menstrual cramping, and heavy menstrual bleeding that leads to anemia. Quality of life is diminished due to the chronic pain and discomfort. Though fibroids don't always make it impossible to become pregnant, infertility and pregnancy loss may occur as well as pre-term delivery.\nFibroids can be diagnosed through a routine pelvic exam or ultrasound in a doctor's office.\nA gynecologist can prescribe various medications to ease the symptoms and regulate the menstrual cycle. There are also a number of surgical techniques, some minimally invasive, to shrink or remove the fibroids while leaving the uterus in place. Hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, is an option in some cases.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nvaginal bleeding, pelvis pain, abdominal cramps (stomach cramps), painful periods, irregular period\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nBoil (furuncle)\nA furuncle, also called a boil, is infection of a hair follicle. The infection forms under the skin at the root of the hair and may occur anywhere on the body.\nThe infection is caused by bacteria, most often Staphylococcus aureus or \"staph.\" Irritation caused by clothes or anything else rubbing the skin can cause the skin to break down and allow bacteria to enter.\nStaph bacteria are found everywhere. Frequent and thorough handwashing, and otherwise maintaining cleanliness, will help to prevent its spread.\nMost susceptible are those with a weakened immune system; diabetes; and other skin infections.\nSymptoms include a single bump under the skin that is swollen, painful, and red, and contains pus.\nIt is important to treat the boil, since infection can spread into the bloodstream and travel throughout the body.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination and sometimes fluid sample from the boil.\nTreatment may involve incision and drainage of the infection, followed by creams to apply to the site of the boil and/or a course of antibiotic medicine.\nRarity:\nUncommon\nTop Symptoms:\npink or red facial bump, small facial lump, painful facial bump, marble sized facial lump, constant skin changes\nSymptoms that always occur with boil (furuncle):\npink or red facial bump\nSymptoms that never occur with boil (furuncle):\nfever\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nOvarian cyst\nDuring her reproductive years, a woman's ovaries release a single egg cell each month. But sometimes the egg remains on the surface of the ovary, where the follicle that enclosed it continues to grow. It then becomes a fluid-filled ovarian cyst.\nOvarian cysts may be caused by hormonal imbalances; by endometriosis tissue, if it attaches to the ovary; and by severe pelvic infections that spread to the ovaries. Cysts may also form during pregnancy.\nSmall ovarian cysts often cause no symptoms. Larger cysts may cause pelvic pain, backache, unexplained weight gain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and/or pain during sex. Ovarian cysts are almost never a form of cancer.\nSudden, severe abdominal pain could indicate a ruptured cyst. This is a medical emergency and the patient should go to an emergency room or call 9-1-1.\nDiagnosis is made through ultrasound.\nHormonal birth control, such as the pill, injection, or patch, prevents ovulation and therefore prevents the formation of cysts. Surgery to remove the cyst may be necessary in some cases.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nstomach bloating, vaginal bleeding, pelvis pain, lower abdominal pain, lower back pain\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nPainful Abdominal Lump Symptom Checker\nTake a quiz to find out what might be causing your painful abdominal lump\nTake quiz\nSkin abscess\nA skin abscess is a large pocket of pus that has formed just beneath the skin. It is caused by bacteria getting under the skin, usually through a small cut or scratch, and beginning to multiply. The body fights the invasion with white blood cells, which kill some of the infected tissue but form pus within the cavity that remains.\nSymptoms include a large, red, swollen, painful lump of pus anywhere on the body beneath the skin. There may be fever, chills, and body aches from the infection.\nIf not treated, there is the risk of an abscess enlarging, spreading, and causing serious illness.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination.\nA small abscess may heal on its own, through the body's immune system. But some will need to be drained or lanced in a medical provider's office so that the pus can be cleaned out. Antibiotics are usually prescribed.\nKeeping the skin clean, and using only clean clothes and towels, will help to make sure that the abscess does not recur.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nrash with bumps or blisters, red rash, red skin bump larger than 1/2 cm in diameter, pus-filled rash, rash\nSymptoms that always occur with skin abscess:\nrash with bumps or blisters\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nSevere skin abscess\nA skin abscess is an infection of the deeper skin that\n'\ns typically due to bacteria seen on the skin. Recently, infections are more frequently caused by Staph. Aureus (puts the\n\"\nstaph\n\"\nin\n\"\nstaph infections\n\"\n). If the infection begins to spread, urgent treatment is required.\nRarity:\nRare\nTop Symptoms:\nfatigue, fever, painful neck lump, marble-size neck lump, pink or red neck bump\nSymptoms that always occur with severe skin abscess:\npink or red neck bump, red bump\nUrgency:\nHospital emergency room\nSkin cyst\nA cyst is a small sac or lump, filled with fluid, air, fat, or other material, that begins to grow somewhere in the body for no apparent reason. A skin cyst is one that forms just beneath the skin.\nIt's believed that skin cysts form around trapped keratin cells \u2013 the cells that form the relatively tough outer layer of the skin.\nThese cysts are not contagious.\nAnyone can get a skin cyst, but they are most common in those who are over age 18, have acne, or have injured the skin.\nSymptoms include the appearance of a small, rounded lump under the skin. Cysts are normally painless unless infected, when they will be reddened and sore and contain pus.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination. A small cyst can be left alone, though if it is unsightly or large enough to interfere with movement it can be removed in a simple procedure done in a doctor's office. An infected cyst must be treated so that the infection does not spread.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nskin-colored armpit bump, marble sized armpit lump, small armpit lump\nSymptoms that always occur with skin cyst:\nskin-colored armpit bump\nUrgency:\nWait and watch\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Painful Abdominal Lump\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nHow would you describe the location of your abdominal lump/bump the best?\nWhat color is the bump?\nAny fever today or during the last week?\nDo you have a rash?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
