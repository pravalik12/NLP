Note: Heartburn is a separate condition.\nCommon causes are eating too much or too rapidly; greasy or spicy foods; overdoing caffeine, alcohol, or carbonated beverages; smoking; and anxiety. Some antibiotics, pain relievers, and vitamin/mineral supplements can cause indigestion.\nThe most common symptoms are pain, discomfort, and bloating in the upper abdomen soon after eating.\nIndigestion that lasts longer than two weeks, and does not respond to simple treatment, may indicate a more serious condition. Upper abdominal pain that radiates to the jaw, neck, or arm is a medical emergency.\nDiagnosis is made through patient history and physical examination. If the symptoms began suddenly, laboratory tests on blood, breath, and stool may be ordered. Upper endoscopy or abdominal x-ray may be done.\nFor functional dyspepsia \u2013 \"ordinary\" indigestion \u2013 treatment and prevention are the same.

Fibroids are almost never associated with cancer.\nThose at higher risk include black women and women who started their periods at a young age. Other risk factors are vitamin D deficiency, poor diet, obesity, drinking alcohol, and family history of fibroids.\nFibroids can cause pelvic pressure and pain, severe menstrual cramping, and heavy menstrual bleeding that leads to anemia. Quality of life is diminished due to the chronic pain and discomfort. Though fibroids don't always make it impossible to become pregnant, infertility and pregnancy loss may occur as well as pre-term delivery.\nFibroids can be diagnosed through a routine pelvic exam or ultrasound in a doctor's office.\nA gynecologist can prescribe various medications to ease the symptoms and regulate the menstrual cycle. There are also a number of surgical techniques, some minimally invasive, to shrink or remove the fibroids while leaving the uterus in place. Hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, is an option in some cases.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nvaginal bleeding, pelvis pain, abdominal cramps (stomach cramps), painful periods, irregular period\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nChronic constipation\nConstipation is a very common condition affecting the large intestine.

However, it is possible to get PID from other causes.\nAny woman can be affected. It is most often found in sexually active women under age 25, especially those who have had PID before, have multiple partners, and/or douche frequently.\nSymptoms include fever, lower abdominal pain, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, pain and/or bleeding during sex, and pain on urination.\nUntreated PID can cause infertility due to damaged tissue in the reproductive tract, as well as chronic pelvic and abdominal pain. Unprotected sex partners will be infected as well.\nDiagnosis is made through symptoms, pelvic examination, vaginal and cervical swabs, and urine tests.\nTreatment is with a course of antibiotics. Be sure to finish all of the medication as directed, even when you begin feeling better.\nTo prevent PID, have all partners (male or female) tested for STDs and avoid unprotected sexual contact.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nfever, abdominal pain or unusual vaginal discharge, vaginal discharge, nausea or vomiting, vaginal bleeding, pelvis pain\nSymptoms that always occur with pelvic inflammatory disease:\nfever, abdominal pain or unusual vaginal discharge\nUrgency:\nIn-person visit\nOvulation pain (mittelschmerz) or midcycle spotting\nMittelschmerz is a German word that translates as \"middle pain.\" It refers to the normal discomfort sometimes felt by women during ovulation, which is at the midpoint of the menstrual cycle.\nEach month, one of the two ovaries forms a follicle that holds an egg cell. The pain occurs when the follicle ruptures and releases the egg.\nThis is a dull, cramping sensation that may begin suddenly in only one side of the lower abdomen. In a few cases, there may be vaginal spotting. Mittelschmerz occurs about 14 days before the start of the next menstrual period.\nActual Mittelschmerz is not associated with nausea, vomiting, fever, or severe pelvic pain. These symptoms should be evaluated by a medical provider since they can indicate a more serious condition.\nDiagnosis is made through patient history.\nTreatment requires only over-the-counter, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve the pain. An oral contraceptive will stop the symptoms, since it also stops ovulation.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), last period approximately 2 weeks ago, vaginal bleeding, bloody vaginal discharge, pelvis pain\nSymptoms that always occur with ovulation pain (mittelschmerz) or midcycle spotting:\nlast period approximately 2 weeks ago\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nAppendicitis\nAppendicitis refers to inflammation of the appendix, a small finger-like structure in the lower right corner of the belly.

If something blocks the flow of bile out of the gallbladder \u2013 gallstones, damage to the bile ducts, or tumors in the gallbladder \u2013 the bile stagnates and bacteria multiplies in it, producing an infected gallbladder.\nRisk factors include obesity, a high-fat diet, and a family history of gallstones.\nSymptoms include fever; chills; right upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the right shoulder; and sometimes nausea and vomiting. A gallbladder infection is an acute (sudden) illness, while the symptoms of gallstones come on gradually.\nUntreated cholecystitis can lead to rupture of the gallbladder, which can be life-threatening.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination, ultrasound or other imaging, and blood tests.\nTreatment involves hospitalizing the patient for fasting with IV fluids, to rest the gallbladder; antibiotics; and pain medication. Surgery to remove the gallbladder is often done so that the condition cannot recur.\nRarity:\nUncommon\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation\nSymptoms that always occur with gall bladder infection (cholecystitis):\nabdominal pain (stomach ache)\nSymptoms that never occur with gall bladder infection (cholecystitis):\npain in the upper left abdomen, pain in the lower left abdomen\nUrgency:\nHospital emergency room\nNormal abdominal pain\nThe complaint of nonspecific abdominal pain and discomfort, with no apparent cause, is one of the most common in medicine. It is a primary reason for patients to visit a medical provider or the emergency room.\nThe cause of abdominal pain can be difficult to find, because it can come from many different sources: the digestive tract, the urinary tract, the pancreas, the gall bladder, or the gynecologic organs.\nThe pain may simply be caused by overly sensitive nerves in the gut. This hypersensitivity can occur after repeated abdominal injury and/or it may have an emotional cause due to fear of the pain itself.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination, patient history, and simply ruling out any other condition. CT scan is often requested, but can rarely find a specific cause. The benefits must be weighed against the risks of radiation.\nTreatment first involves making any needed lifestyle improvements regarding diet, exercise, work, and sleep, in order to reduce stress. In some cases, counseling, hypnosis, mild pain relievers, and antidepressants are helpful.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache), vaginal discharge, fever, nausea\nSymptoms that always occur with normal abdominal pain:\nabdominal pain (stomach ache)\nSymptoms that never occur with normal abdominal pain:\nfever, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, severe abdominal pain, unintentional weight loss, vaginal discharge\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Dull Abdominal Pain\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nHave you experienced any nausea?\nAny fever today or during the last week?\nHave you been feeling more tired than usual, lethargic or fatigued despite sleeping a normal amount?\nHave you lost your appetite recently?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
