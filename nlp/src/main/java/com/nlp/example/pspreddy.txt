This list does not constitute medical advice and may not accurately represent what you have.\nLipoma\nLipoma is a word that translates as \"fatty tumor,\" but a lipoma is not cancer. It is simply a growth of fat between the muscle layer and the skin above it.\nThe exact cause is not known. The condition does run in families and is associated with other unusual syndromes such as adiposis dolorosa, which is similar. Lipomas most often appear after age 40.\nSymptoms include a soft, easily moveable lump beneath the skin, about two inches across. A lipoma is painless unless its growth is irritating the nerves around it. They are most often found on the back, neck, and abdomen, and sometimes the arms and upper legs.\nIt is a good idea to have any new or unusual growth checked by a medical provider, just to make certain it is benign.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination, biopsy, and imaging such as ultrasound or CT scan.\nMost of the time, treatment is not necessary unless the lipoma is unsightly or is interfering with other structures. It can be removed through surgery or liposuction.\nRarity:\nUncommon\nTop Symptoms:\nskin-colored groin bump, marble sized groin lump, small groin lump\nSymptoms that always occur with lipoma:\nskin-colored groin bump\nUrgency:\nWait and watch\nSkin cyst\nA cyst is a small sac or lump, filled with fluid, air, fat, or other material, that begins to grow somewhere in the body for no apparent reason. A skin cyst is one that forms just beneath the skin.\nIt's believed that skin cysts form around trapped keratin cells \u2013 the cells that form the relatively tough outer layer of the skin.\nThese cysts are not contagious.\nAnyone can get a skin cyst, but they are most common in those who are over age 18, have acne, or have injured the skin.\nSymptoms include the appearance of a small, rounded lump under the skin. Cysts are normally painless unless infected, when they will be reddened and sore and contain pus.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination. A small cyst can be left alone, though if it is unsightly or large enough to interfere with movement it can be removed in a simple procedure done in a doctor's office. An infected cyst must be treated so that the infection does not spread.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nskin-colored armpit bump, marble sized armpit lump, small armpit lump\nSymptoms that always occur with skin cyst:\nskin-colored armpit bump\nUrgency:\nWait and watch\nSkin abscess\nA skin abscess is a large pocket of pus that has formed just beneath the skin. It is caused by bacteria getting under the skin, usually through a small cut or scratch, and beginning to multiply. The body fights the invasion with white blood cells, which kill some of the infected tissue but form pus within the cavity that remains.\nSymptoms include a large, red, swollen, painful lump of pus anywhere on the body beneath the skin. There may be fever, chills, and body aches from the infection.\nIf not treated, there is the risk of an abscess enlarging, spreading, and causing serious illness.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination.\nA small abscess may heal on its own, through the body's immune system. But some will need to be drained or lanced in a medical provider's office so that the pus can be cleaned out. Antibiotics are usually prescribed.\nKeeping the skin clean, and using only clean clothes and towels, will help to make sure that the abscess does not recur.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nrash with bumps or blisters, red rash, red skin bump larger than 1/2 cm in diameter, pus-filled rash, rash\nSymptoms that always occur with skin abscess:\nrash with bumps or blisters\nUrgency:\nPrimary care doctor\nAbdominal Bump Symptom Checker\nTake a quiz to find out what might be causing your abdominal bump\nTake quiz\nDermatofibroma\nA dermatofibroma is a common skin growth that usually appears on the lower legs, but may appear anywhere on the body. These growths are benign (noncancerous). Dermatofibromas are most common in adults and are rarely found in children.\nSymptoms include a hard, raised growth that is red, pink, ...\nRead more\nPimple\nPimples are also called comedones, spots, blemishes, or \"zits.\" Medically, they are small skin eruptions filled with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria.\nPimples often first start appearing at puberty, when hormones increase the production of oil in the skin and sometimes clog the pores.\nMost susceptible are teenagers from about ages 13 to 17.\nSymptoms include blocked pores that may appear flat and black on the surface, because the oil darkens when exposed to the air; blocked pores that appear white on the surface because they have closed over with dead skin cells; or swollen, yellow-white, pus-filled blisters surrounded by reddened skin.\nOutbreaks of pimples on the skin can interfere with quality of life, making the person self-conscious about their appearance and causing pain and discomfort in the skin. A medical provider can help to manage the condition, sometimes through referral to a dermatologist.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination.\nTreatment involves improving diet; keeping the skin, hair, washcloths, and towels very clean; and using over-the-counter acne remedies.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\npink or red facial bump, small facial lump, painful facial bump, marble sized facial lump\nSymptoms that always occur with pimple:\npink or red facial bump\nUrgency:\nSelf-treatment\nBenign skin growth\nBenign skin growths are very common and virtually everyone has some form of them. \"Benign\" means the growth is not cancerous and not harmful. Some of these growths have genetic origins, and for some the cause is not clear.\nCommon types are:\nBirthmarks \u2013 may appear as flat \"stains\" in the skin or as raised clusters formed of tiny blood vessels.\nMoles \u2013 small irregularities that originate in the pigment-producing cells in the skin. They can be almost any shape or color but are normally no larger than one-quarter of an inch across.\nSkin tags \u2013 little irregular flaps of skin, like a flattened mole attached on only one side.\nKeloids \u2013 a dark, fibrous form of scar tissue that forms after a skin wound, either from trauma or from surgery.\nAs a person ages, more changes may appear in the skin. Most are benign, but any unusual or suspicious skin growth should be checked by a medical provider. The growth can be removed if it is unsightly, interferes with clothing, or proves to be malignant (cancerous.)\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nconstant skin changes, itchy rash, rash with well-defined border, abdominal skin changes, neck skin changes\nSymptoms that always occur with benign skin growth:\nconstant skin changes\nSymptoms that never occur with benign skin growth:\ncherry red lower leg bump\nUrgency:\nWait and watch\nMolluscum contagiosum\nMolluscum contagiosum, also called \"water warts,\" is a common, benign, viral skin infection. It causes a rash of bumps that may appear anywhere on the body.\nThe virus spreads through direct contact with the bumps, including sexual contact. It also spreads through touching any object that an infected person has handled, such as clothing, towels, and toys.\nMost susceptible are children under age 10. Other risk factors include dermatitis causing breaks in the skin; a weakened immune system; and living in warm, humid regions under crowded conditions.\nSymptoms include a rash of small, pale bumps with a pit in the center. The rash is usually painless but may become reddened, itchy, and sore.\nDiagnosis is made through physical examination.\nIn some cases, treatment is not needed and the condition will clear on its own. However, if the bumps are unsightly or are present in the genital area, lesions can be removed through minor surgical procedures or treated with oral medication or topical agents.\nRarity:\nCommon\nTop Symptoms:\nrash with bumps or blisters, leg skin changes, skin changes on arm, head or neck skin changes, genital skin changes\nSymptoms that never occur with molluscum contagiosum:\nfever, headache\nUrgency:\nPhone call or in-person visit\nQuestions Your Doctor May Ask About Abdominal Bump\nTo diagnose this condition, your doctor would likely ask the following questions:\nWhat color is the bump?\nHow would you describe the location of your abdominal lump/bump the best?\nDo you feel pain when you touch the bump?\nDo you have a rash?\nThe above questions are also covered by our A.I.
